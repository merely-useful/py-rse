A \gref{version control system}{version_control_system} tracks changes to files\index{version control}
and helps people share those changes with each other.
These things can be done by emailing files to colleagues
or by using Microsoft Word and Google Docs,
but version control does both more accurately and efficiently.
Originally developed to support software development,
over the past fifteen years it has become the cornerstone
of \gref{reproducible research}{reproducible_research}.\index{reproducible research!version control}

Version control works by storing a master copy of your code in a repository,
which you can't edit directly.
Instead, you check out a working copy of the code,
edit that code, then commit changes back to the repository.
In this way, version control records a complete revision history (i.e., of every commit),
so that you can retrieve and compare previous versions at any time.
This is useful from an individual viewpoint,
because you don't need to store multiple (but slightly different) copies of the same script
(Figure \@ref(fig:git-cmdline-phdcomics)).
It's also useful from a collaboration viewpoint,
because the system keeps a record of who made what changes and when.

```{r git-cmdline-phdcomics, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Managing different versions of a file without version control."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/git-cmdline/phd-comics.png")
```

There are many different version control systems,
such as CVS, Subversion, and Mercurial,
but the most widely used version control system today is \gref{Git}{git}.
Many people first encounter it through a GUI like [GitKraken][gitkraken]
or [the RStudio IDE][rstudio-ide].
However,
these tools are actually wrappers around Git's original command-line interface,
which gives us access to all of Git's features.
This lesson describes how to perform fundamental operations using that interface;
Chapter \@ref(git-advanced) then introduces more advanced operations
that can be used to implement a smoother research workflow.

To show how Git works,
we will apply it to the Zipf's Law project.
Our project directory should currently include:

```text
zipf/
├── bin
│   ├── book_summary.sh
│   ├── collate.py
│   ├── countwords.py
│   ├── plotcounts.py
│   ├── script_template.py
│   └── utilities.py
├── data
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── dracula.txt
│   ├── frankenstein.txt

└── results
    ├── dracula.csv
    ├── jane_eyre.csv
    ├── jane_eyre.png
    └── moby_dick.csv
```

`bin/plotcounts.py` is the solution to Exercise \@ref(scripting-ex-better-plotting);
over the course of this chapter
we will edit it to produce more informative plots.
Initially,
it looks like this:

```python
"""Plot word counts."""

import argparse

import pandas as pd


def main(args):
    """Run the command line program."""
    df = pd.read_csv(args.infile, header=None,
                     names=('word', 'word_frequency'))
    df['rank'] = df['word_frequency'].rank(ascending=False,
                                           method='max')
    df['inverse_rank'] = 1 / df['rank']
    ax = df.plot.scatter(x='word_frequency',
                         y='inverse_rank',
                         figsize=[12, 6],
                         grid=True,
                         xlim=args.xlim)
    ax.figure.savefig(args.outfile)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=__doc__)
    parser.add_argument('infile', type=argparse.FileType('r'),
                        nargs='?', default='-',
                        help='Word count csv file name')
    parser.add_argument('--outfile', type=str,
                        default='plotcounts.png',
                        help='Output image file name')
    parser.add_argument('--xlim', type=float, nargs=2,
                        metavar=('XMIN', 'XMAX'),
                        default=None, help='X-axis limits')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    main(args)
```

## Setting Up {#git-cmdline-setup}

We write Git commands as `git verb options`,
where the \gref{subcommand}{subcommand} `verb` tells Git what we want to do
and `options` provide whatever additional information that subcommand needs.
Using this syntax,
the first thing we need to do is configure Git.\index{Git!configuration}\index{configuration!Git}\index{Git commands!config}

```bash
$ git config --global user.name "Amira Khan"
$ git config --global user.email "amira@zipf.org"
```

(Please use your own name and email address instead of the one shown.)
Here,
`config` is the verb
and the rest of the command are options.
We put the name in quotation marks because it contains a space;
we don't actually need to quote the email address,
but do so for consistency.
Since we are going to be using GitHub,
the email address should be the same as you have or intend to use
when setting up your GitHub account.

The `--global` option tells Git to use the settings for all of our projects on this computer,
so these two commands only need to be run once.
However,
we can re-run them any time if we want to change our details.
We can also check our settings using the `--list` option:

```bash
$ git config --list
```

```text
user.name=Amira Khan
user.email=amira@zipf.org
core.autocrlf=input
core.editor=nano
core.repositoryformatversion=0
core.filemode=true
core.bare=false
core.ignorecase=true
...
```

Depending on your operating system and version of Git, 
your configuration list may look a bit different.
Most of these differences shouldn't matter right now,
as long as your username and email are accurate.

> **Git Help and Manual**
>
> If we forget a Git command,
> we can list which ones are available using `--help`:
>
> ```bash
> $ git --help
> ```
>
> This option also gives us more information about specific commands:
>
> ```bash
> $ git config --help
> ```

## Creating a New Repository {#git-cmdline-repos}

Once Git is configured,
we can use it to track work on our Zipf's Law project.
Let's make sure we are in the top-level directory of our project:

```bash
$ cd ~/zipf
$ ls
```

```text
 bin       data      results
```

We want to make this directory a \gref{repository}{repository},\index{repository (version control)}\index{Git commands!init}
i.e.,
a place where Git can store versions of our files.
We do this using the `init` command with `.` to mean "the current directory":

```bash
$ git init .
```

```text
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/amira/zipf/.git/
```

`ls` seems to show that nothing has changed:

```bash
$ ls
```

```text
bin     data    results
```

but if we add the `-a` flag to show everything,
we can see that Git has created a hidden directory within `zipf` called `.git`:\index{Git!.git directory}

```bash
$ ls -a
```

```text
.       ..      .git    bin     data    results
```

Git stores information about the project in this special subdirectory.
If we ever delete it,
we will lose that history.

We can check that everything is set up correctly
by asking Git to tell us the status of our project:

```bash
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be
  committed)

        bin/
        data/
        results/

nothing added to commit but untracked files
present (use "git add" to track)
```

"No commits yet" means that Git hasn't recorded any history yet,
while "Untracked files" means Git has noticed that
there are things in `bin/`, `data/` and `results/`
that it is not yet keeping track of.

## Adding Existing Work {#git-cmdline-add-existing}

Now that our project is a repository,
we can tell Git to start recording its history.
To do this,
we add things to the list of things Git is tracking using `git add`.\index{Git commands!add}
We can do this for single files:

```bash
$ git add bin/countwords.py
```

or entire directories:

```bash
$ git add bin
```

The easiest thing to do with an existing project
is to tell Git to add everything in the current directory using `.`:

```bash
$ git add .
```

We can then check the repository's status to see what files have been added:

```bash
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	  new file:   bin/book_summary.sh
	  new file:   bin/collate.py
	  new file:   bin/countwords.py
	  new file:   bin/plotcounts.py
	  new file:   bin/script_template.py
	  new file:   bin/utilities.py
	  new file:   data/README.md
	  new file:   data/dracula.txt
	  new file:   data/frankenstein.txt
	  new file:   data/jane_eyre.txt
	  new file:   data/moby_dick.txt
	  new file:   data/sense_and_sensibility.txt
	  new file:   data/sherlock_holmes.txt
	  new file:   data/time_machine.txt
	  new file:   results/dracula.csv
	  new file:   results/jane_eyre.csv
	  new file:   results/jane_eyre.png
	  new file:   results/moby_dick.csv
```

Adding all of our existing files this way is easy,
but we can accidentally add things that should never be in version control,
such as files containing passwords or other sensitive information.
The output of `git status` tells us that\index{Git commands!status}
we can remove such files from the list of things to be saved
using `git rm --cached`;\index{Git commands!rm}
we will practice this in Exercise \@ref(git-cmdline-ex-unsave).

> **What to Save**
>
> We always want to save programs, manuscripts,
> and everything else we have created by hand
> in version control.
> In this project,
> we have also chosen to save our data files
> and the results we have generated
> (including our plots).
> This is a project-specific decision:
> if these files are very large,
> for example,
> we may decide to save them elsewhere,
> while if they are easy to re-create,
> we may not save them at all.
> We will explore this issue further in Chapter \@ref(provenance).

We no longer have any untracked files,
but the tracked files haven't been \gref{committed}{commit}\index{Git commands!commit}\index{commit!to version control}
(i.e., saved permanently in our project's history).
We can do this using `git commit`:

```bash
$ git commit -m "Add scripts, novels, word counts, and plots"
```

```text
[master (root-commit) 173222b] Add scripts, novels, word 
    counts, and plots

 create mode 100644 results/jane_eyre.csv
 create mode 100644 results/jane_eyre.png
 create mode 100644 results/moby_dick.csv
```

`git commit` takes everything we have told Git to save using `git add`
and stores a copy permanently inside the repository's `.git` directory.
This permanent copy is called a \gref{commit}{commit} or a \gref{revision}{revision}.\index{commit!set of files}
Git gives is a unique identifier,
and the first line of output from `git commit` displays
its \gref{short identifier}{short_identifier_git} `2dc78f0`,\index{Git!short identifier}\index{short identifier (in Git)}
which is the first few characters of that unique label.

We use the `-m` option (short for **m**essage)
to record a short comment with the commit
to remind us later what we did and why.
(Once again,
we put it in double quotes because it contains spaces.)
If we run `git status` now:

```bash
$ git status
```

the output tells us that
all of our existing work is tracked and up to date:

```text
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

This first commit becomes the starting point of our project's history:
we won't be able to see changes made before this point.
This implies that we should make our project a Git repository
as soon as we create it
rather than after we have done some work.

## Describing Commits {#git-cmdline-commit-message}

If we run `git commit` *without* the `-m` option,
Git opens a text editor
so that we can write a longer \gref{commit message}{commit_message}.\index{Git!commit message}\index{commit!message}
In this message,
the first line is referred to as the "subject"
and the rest as the "body",
just as in an email.

When we use `-m`,
we are only writing the subject line;
this makes things easier in the short run,
but if our project's history fills up with one-liners like
"Fixed problem" or "Updated",
our future self will wish that we had taken a few extra seconds
to explain things in a little more detail.
Following [these guidelines][desc-cmt-msgs] will help:

1.  Separate the subject from the body with a blank line
    so that it is easy to spot.
2.  Limit subject lines to 50 characters so that they are easy to scan.
3.  Write the subject line in Title Case (like a section heading).
4.  Do not end the subject line with a period.
5.  Write as if giving a command
    (e.g., "Make each plot half the width of the page").
6.  Wrap the body
    (i.e., insert line breaks to format text as paragraphs
    rather than relying on editors to wrap lines automatically).
7.  Use the body to explain what and why rather than how.

## Saving and Tracking Changes {#git-cmdline-changes}

Our initial commit gave us a starting point.
The process to build on top of it is similar:
first add the file, then commit changes.
Let's check that we're in the right directory:

```bash
$ pwd
```

```text
/Users/amira/zipf
```

Let's use `plotcounts.py` to plot the word counts in `results/dracula.csv`:

```bash
$ python bin/plotcounts.py results/dracula.csv --outfile
  results/dracula.png
```

If we check the status of our repository again,
Git tells us that we have a new file:

```bash
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be
  committed)
    results/dracula.png

nothing added to commit but untracked files
present (use "git add" to track)
```

Git isn't tracking this file yet because we haven't told it to.
Let's do that with `git add` and then commit our change:

```bash
$ git add results/dracula.png
$ git commit -m "Add plot of word counts for 'Dracula'"
```

```text
[master 851d590] Add plot of word counts for 'Dracula'
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 results/dracula.png
```

If we want to know what we've done recently,
we can display the project's history using `git log`:\index{Git commands!log}

```bash
$ git log
```

```text
commit 851d590a214c7859eafa0998c6c951f8e0eb359b (HEAD -> master)
Author: Amira Khan <amira@zipf.org>
Date:   Sat Dec 19 09:32:41 2020 -0800

    Add plot of word counts for 'Dracula'

commit 173222bf90216b408c8997f4e143572b99637750
Author: Amira Khan <amira@zipf.org>
Date:   Sat Dec 19 09:30:23 2020 -0800

    Add scripts, novels, word counts, and plots
```

`git log` lists all commits made to a repository in reverse chronological order.
The listing for each commit includes
the commit's \gref{full identifier}{full_identifier_git}\index{Git!full identifier}\index{full identifier (in Git)}
(which starts with the same characters as the short identifier printed by `git commit`),
the commit's author,
when it was created,
and the commit message that we wrote.

The plot we have made is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:git-cmdline-initial-plot).
It could be better:
most of the visual space is devoted to a few very common words,
which makes it hard to see what is happening with the other ten thousand or so words.

```{r git-cmdline-initial-plot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Inverse rank versus word frequency for *Dracula*."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/git-cmdline/plot-initial.png")
```

An alternative way to visually evaluate Zipf's Law is
to plot the word frequency against rank on log-log axes.
Let's change the section:

```python
    ax = df.plot.scatter(x='word_frequency',
                         y='inverse_rank',
                         figsize=[12, 6],
                         grid=True,
                         xlim=args.xlim)
```

to put `'rank'` on the y-axis and add `loglog=True`:

```python
    ax = df.plot.scatter(x='word_frequency',
                         y='rank', loglog=True,
                         figsize=[12, 6],
                         grid=True,
                         xlim=args.xlim)
```

When we check our status again,
it prints:

```bash
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be 
  committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in
  working directory)
	  modified:   bin/plotcounts.py

no changes added to commit (use "git add" or "git commit -a")
```

The last line tells us that
a file Git already knows about has been modified.

To save those changes in the repository's history,
we must `git add` and then `git commit`.
Before we do,
though,
let's review the changes using `git diff`.\index{Git commands!diff}\index{diff (in Git)}
This command shows us the differences between the current state of our repository
and the most recently saved version:

```bash
$ git diff
```

```diff
diff --git a/bin/plotcounts.py b/bin/plotcounts.py
index f274473..c4c5b5a 100644
--- a/bin/plotcounts.py
+++ b/bin/plotcounts.py
@@ -13,7 +13,7 @@ def main(args):
                                            method='max')
     df['inverse_rank'] = 1 / df['rank']
     ax = df.plot.scatter(x='word_frequency',
-                         y='inverse_rank',
+                         y='rank', loglog=True,

                          xlim=args.xlim)
```

The output is cryptic,
even by the standards of the Unix command line,
because it is actually a series of commands telling editors and other tools
how to turn the file we *had* into the file we *have*.
If we break it down into pieces:

1.  The first line tells us that Git is producing output
    in the format of the Unix `diff` command.
2.  The second line tells exactly which versions of the file Git is comparing:
    `f274473` and `c4c5b5a` are the short identifiers for those versions.
3.  The third and fourth lines once again show the name of the file being changed;
    the name appears twice in case we are renaming a file as well as modifying it.
4.  The remaining lines show us the changes and the lines on which they occur.
    A minus sign `-` in the first column indicates a line that is being removed,
    while a plus sign `+` shows a line that is being added. Lines without either
    plus or minus signs have not been changed, but are provided around the lines
    that have been changed to add context.

Git's default is to compare line by line,
but it can be instructive to instead compare word by word
using the `--word-diff` or `--color-words` options.
These are particularly useful when running `git diff` on prose rather than code.

After reviewing our change
we can commit it just as we did before:

```bash
$ git commit -m "Plot frequency against rank on log-log axes"
```

```text
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be 
  committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in 
  working directory)
	  modified:   bin/plotcounts.py

no changes added to commit (use "git add" or "git commit -a")
```

Whoops:
we forgot to add the file to the set of things we want to commit.
Let's do that and then try the commit again:

```bash
$ git add bin/plotcounts.py
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	  modified:   bin/plotcounts.py

```

Running `git status` again shows that our plot has been modified:

```text
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be
  committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in
  working directory)
	  modified:   results/dracula.png

no changes added to commit (use "git add" or "git commit -a")
```

Since `results/dracula.png` is a binary file rather than text,
`git diff` can't show what has changed.
It therefore simply tells us that the new file is different from the old one:

```diff
diff --git a/results/dracula.png b/results/dracula.png
index c1f62fd..57a7b70 100644
Binary files a/results/dracula.png and 
b/results/dracula.png differ
```

This is one of the biggest weaknesses of Git
(and other version control systems):
they are built to handle text.
They can track changes to images, PDFs, and other formats,
but they cannot do as much to show or merge differences.
In a better world than ours,
programmers fixed this years ago.

If we are sure we want to save all of our changes,
we can add and commit in a single command
by giving `git commit` the `-a` option:

```bash
$ git commit -a -m "Update dracula plot"
```

```text
[master ee8684c] Update dracula plot
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 rewrite results/dracula.png (99%)
```

The Git commands we've covered so far (`git add`, `git commit`, `git diff`)
represent the tasks you perform in a basic Git workflow in a local repository 
(Figure \@ref(fig:git-cmdline-remote)a).

```{r git-cmdline-remote, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Commands included in basic Git workflows."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/git-cmdline/git-remote.png")
```

## Synchronizing with Other Repositories {#git-cmdline-remotes}

Sooner or later our computer will experience a hardware failure,
be stolen,
or be thrown in the lake by someone who thinks that
we shouldn't spend the entire vacation working on our thesis.
Even before that happens
we will probably want to collaborate with others,
which we can do by linking our local repository
to one stored on a hosting service such as [GitHub][github].

> **Where's My Repository?**
>
> So far we've worked with repositories located on your own computer,
> which we'll also refer to as local or desktop repositories.
> The alternative is hosting repositories on GitHub or another server,
> which we'll refer to as a remote or GitHub repository.

The first steps are to create an account on GitHub,
and then select the option there to create a new remote repository
to synchronize with our local repository.
Select the option on GitHub to create a new repository,
then add the requested information for your Zipf's Law project.
The remote repository doesn't have to have the same name as the local one,
but we will probably get confused if they are different,
so the repository we create on GitHub will also be called `zipf`.
The other default options are likely appropriate for your remote repository.
Because we are synchronizing with an existing repository,
do not add a README, `.gitignore`, or license;
we'll discuss these additions in other chapters.

Next,
we need to connect our desktop repository with the one on GitHub.
We do this by making the GitHub repository a \gref{remote}{remote_repository}\index{Git!remote}\index{remote (in Git)}
of the local repository.
The home page of our new repository on GitHub includes the string we need to identify it
(Figure \@ref(fig:git-cmdline-repo-link)).

```{r git-cmdline-repo-link, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Find the link for a GitHub repository."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/git-cmdline/repo-link.png")
```

We can click on "HTTPS" to change the URL from SSH to HTTPS
and then copy that URL.

> **HTTPS vs. SSH**
>
> We use HTTPS here because it does not require additional configuration.
> If we want to set up SSH access so that we do not have to type in our password as often,
> the tutorials from [GitHub][git-ssh-github],
> [BitBucket][git-ssh-bitbucket],
> or [GitLab][git-ssh-gitlab]
> explain the steps required.

Next,
let's go into the local `zipf` repository and run this command:

```bash
$ cd ~/zipf
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf.git
```

Make sure to use the URL for your repository instead of the one shown:
the only difference should be that it includes your username instead of `amira-khan`.

A Git remote is like a bookmark:\index{Git!remote}\index{Git commands!remote}\index{remote (in Git)}
it gives a short name to a URL.
In this case the remote's name is `origin`;
we could use anything we want,
but `origin` is Git's default,
so we will stick with it.
We can check that the command has worked by running `git remote -v`
(where the `-v` option is short for **v**erbose):

```bash
$ git remote -v
```

```text
origin	https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf.git (push)
```

Git displays two lines because it's actually possible to set up a remote
to download from one URL but upload to another.
Sensible people don't do this,
so we won't explore this possibility any further.

Now that we have configured a remote,
we can \gref{push}{git_push} the work we have done so far\index{Git commands!push}\index{push (in Git)}
to the repository on GitHub:

```bash
$ git push origin master
```

This may prompt us to enter our username and password;
once we do that,
Git prints a few lines of administrative information:

```text
Enumerating objects: 35, done.
Counting objects: 100% (35/35), done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (35/35), done.
Writing objects: 100% (35/35), 2.17 MiB | 602.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 35 (delta 7), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (7/7), done.
To https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master
```

If we view our GitHub repository in the browser,
it now includes all of our project files,
along with all of the commits we have made so far (Figure \@ref(fig:git-cmdline-history)).

```{r git-cmdline-history, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Viewing the repository's history on GitHub."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/git-cmdline/repo-history.png")
```

We can also \gref{pull}{git_pull} changes\index{Git commands!pull}\index{pull (in Git)}
from the remote repository to the local one:

```bash
$ git pull origin master
```

```text
From https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Already up-to-date.
```

Pulling has no effect in this case
because the two repositories are already synchronized.

> **Fetching**
>
> The second line in the remote configuration we viewed earlier is labeled `push`,
> which makes sense given the command we used (`git push`)
> to upload changes from our local to remote repositories.
> Why is the other line labeled `fetch` instead of `pull`?
> Fetching and pulling both download new data from a remote repository,
> but only pulling integrates those changes into your local repository's version history.
> Because `git fetch` doesn't alter your local files, 
> it's used to view changes between local and remote versions.\index{Git commands!fetch}

The Git commands we've covered in this section (`git pull`, `git push`)
are the main tasks associated with incorporating remote repositories into your workflow 
(Figure \@ref(fig:git-cmdline-remote)b).

## Exploring History {#git-cmdline-history}

Git lets us look at previous versions of files
and restore specific files to earlier states if we want to.
In order to do these things,
we need to identify the versions we want.

The two ways to do this
are analogous to \gref{absolute}{absolute_path} and \gref{relative}{relative_path} paths.
The "absolute" version is the unique identifier that Git gives to each commit.
These identifiers are 40 characters long,
but in most situations Git will let us use just the first half dozen characters or so.
For example,
if we run `git log`\index{Git commands!log} right now,
it shows us something like this:

```text

Author: Amira Khan <amira@zipf.org>
Date:   Sat Dec 19 09:30:23 2020 -0800

    Add scripts, novels, word counts, and plots
```

The commit in which we changed `plotcounts.py`
has the absolute identifier `582f7f6f536d520b1328c04c9d41e24b54170656`,
but we can use `582f7f6` to reference it in almost all situations.

While `git log` includes the commit message,
it doesn't tell us exactly what changes were made in each commit.
If we add the `-p` option (short for **p**atch),
we get the same kind of details `git diff` provides
to describe the changes in each commit:

```bash
$ git log -p
```

The first part of the output is shown below;
we have truncated the rest,
since it is very long:

```diff

...
```

Alternatively,
we can use `git diff` directly\index{Git commands!diff}
to examine the differences between files at any stage in the repository's history.
Let's explore this with the `plotcounts.py` file.
We no longer need the line of code in `plotcounts.py`
that calculates the inverse rank:

```python
df['inverse_rank'] = 1 / df['rank']
```

If we delete that line from `bin/plotcounts.py`,
`git diff` on its own will show
the difference between the file as it is now and the most recent version:

```diff
diff --git a/bin/plotcounts.py b/bin/plotcounts.py

`git diff 582f7f6`,
on the other hand,
shows the difference between the current state
and the commit referenced by the short identifier:

Note that you will need to reference your `git log` to replace `582f7f6` in the code above,
since Git assigned your commit a different unique identifier.
Note also that we have *not* committed the last change to `plotcounts.py`;
we will look at ways of undoing it in the next section.

The "relative" version of history relies on a special identifier called `HEAD`,\index{Git!HEAD}\index{HEAD (in Git)}
which always refers to the most recent version in the repository.
`git diff HEAD` therefore shows the same thing as `git diff`,
but instead of typing in a version identifier to back up one commit,
we can use `HEAD~1` (where `~` is the tilde symbol).\index{Git!relative revision}
This shorthand is read "HEAD minus one,"
and gives us the difference to the previous saved version.
`git diff HEAD~2` goes back two revisions and so on.
We can also look at the differences between two saved versions
by separating their identifiers with two dots `..` like this:

```bash
$ git diff HEAD~1..HEAD~2
```

```diff
diff --git a/bin/plotcounts.py b/bin/plotcounts.py

If we wanted to view the contents of a file
at a given point in the version history, 
we could use the same command,
but separating the identifier and file with a colon:

```shell
$ git show HEAD~1:bin/plotcounts.py
```

This allows us to look through the file using a paging program.

## Restoring Old Versions of Files {#git-cmdline-restore}

We can see what we changed,
but how can we restore it?\index{Git!restore old versions}
Suppose we change our mind about the last update to `bin/plotcounts.py`
(removing `df['inverse_rank'] = 1 / df['rank']`)
before we add or commit it.
`git status` tells us that the file has been changed,
but those changes haven't been \gref{staged}{git_stage}:\index{Git!staging area}

```bash
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be 
  committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in 
  working directory)
	modified:   bin/plotcounts.py

no changes added to commit (use "git add" or "git commit -a")
```

We can put things back the way they were in the last saved revision 
using `git restore`,\index{Git commands!restore}
as the screen output suggests:

```bash
$ git restore bin/plotcounts.py
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

As its name suggests,
`git restore` restores an earlier version of a file.
In this case,
we used it to recover the version of the file in the most recent commit.

> **Checking Out with Git**
>
> If you're running a different version of Git,
> you may see a suggestion for `git checkout` instead of `git restore`.
> As of Git version 2.29,
> `git restore` is still an experimental command,
> and operates as a specialized form of `git checkout`.
> `git checkout HEAD bin/plotcounts.py` is equivalent to the last command run.\index{Git commands!checkout}

We can confirm the file has been restored
by printing the relevant lines of the file:

```bash
$ head -n 19 bin/plotcounts.py | tail -n 8
```

```text
    df['rank'] = df['word_frequency'].rank(ascending=False,
                                           method='max')
    df['inverse_rank'] = 1 / df['rank']
    ax = df.plot.scatter(x='word_frequency',
                         y='rank', loglog=True,
                         figsize=[12, 6],
                         grid=True,
                         xlim=args.xlim)
```

Because `git restore` is designed to restore working files, 
we'll need to use `git checkout` to revert to earlier versions of files.\index{Git commands!checkout}
We can use a specific commit identifier rather than `HEAD` to go back as far as we want:

```bash
$ git checkout 851d590 bin/plotcounts.py
```

```text
Updated 1 path from c8d6a33
```

Doing this does not change the history:
`git log` still shows our four commits.
Instead,
it replaces the content of the file with the old content:

```bash
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	  modified:   bin/plotcounts.py
```

```bash
$ head -n 19 bin/plotcounts.py | tail -n 8
```

```text
    df['rank'] = df['word_frequency'].rank(ascending=False,
                                           method='max')
    df['inverse_rank'] = 1 / df['rank']
    ax = df.plot.scatter(x='word_frequency',
                         y='inverse_rank',
                         figsize=[12, 6],
                         grid=True,
                         xlim=args.xlim)
```

If we change our mind again,
we can use the suggestion in the output to restore the earlier version.
Because checking out the changes added them to the staging area,
we need to first remove them from the staging area:

```bash
$ git restore --staged bin/plotcounts.py
```

However,
the changes have been unstaged but still exist in the file.
We can return the file to the state of the most recent commit:

```bash
$ git restore bin/plotcounts.py
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

```bash
$ head -n 19 bin/plotcounts.py | tail -n 8
```

```text
    df['rank'] = df['word_frequency'].rank(ascending=False,
                                           method='max')
    df['inverse_rank'] = 1 / df['rank']
    ax = df.plot.scatter(x='word_frequency',
                         y='rank', loglog=True,
                         figsize=[12, 6],
                         grid=True,
                         xlim=args.xlim)
```

We have restored the most recent commit.
Since we didn't commit the change
that removed the line that calculates the inverse rank,
that work is now lost:
Git can only go back and forth between committed versions of files.

This section has demonstrated a few different ways to view differences among versions,
and to work with those changes (Figure \@ref(fig:git-cmdline-remote)c). 
These commands can operate on either individual files or entire commits,
and the behavior of them can sometimes differ based on your version of Git.
Remember to reference documentation,
and use `git status` and `git log` frequently to understand your workflow.

## Ignoring Files {#git-cmdline-ignore}

We don't always want Git to track every file's history.
For example,
we might want to track text files with names ending in `.txt`
but not data files with names ending in `.dat`.

To stop Git from telling us about these files every time we call `git status`,
we can create a file in the root directory of our project called `.gitignore`.\index{Git!ignoring files}\index{.gitignore file (in Git)}
This file can contain filenames like `thesis.pdf`
or \gref{wildcard}{wildcard} patterns like `*.dat`.\index{wildcard!in .gitignore}
Each must be on a line of its own,
and Git will ignore anything that matches any of these lines.
For now we only need one entry in our `.gitignore` file:

```text
__pycache__
```

which tells Git to ignore any `__pycache__` directory created by Python\index{\_\_pycache\_\_ directory!ignoring in Git}
(Section \@ref(scripting-modules)).

> **Remember to Ignore**
>
> Don't forget to commit `.gitignore` to your repository
> so that Git knows to use it.

## Summary {#git-cmdline-summary}

The biggest benefit of version control for individual research is that
we can always go back to the precise set of files
that we used to produce a particular result.
While Git is complex [@Pere2013],
being able to back up our changes on sites like GitHub
with just a few keystrokes can save us a lot of pain,
and some of Git's advanced features make it even more powerful.
We will explore these in the next chapter.

## Exercises {#git-cmdline-exercises}

### Places to create Git repositories {#git-cmdline-ex-places}

Along with information about the Zipf's Law project,
Amira would also like to keep some notes on [Heaps' Law][heaps-law].
Despite her colleagues' concerns,
Amira creates a `heaps-law` project inside her `zipf` project as follows:

```bash
$ cd ~/zipf         # go into zipf directory (it's a Git repo)
$ mkdir heaps-law   # make a subdirectory zipf/heaps-law
$ cd heaps-law      # go into heaps-law subdirectory
$ git init heaps-law     # make heaps-law a Git repository
```

Is the `git init` command that she runs inside the `heaps-law` subdirectory
required for tracking files stored there?

### Removing before saving {#git-cmdline-ex-unsave}

If you're working on an older version of Git,
you may see an output from `git status` suggesting
you can take files out of the staging area
using `git rm --cached`.
Try this out:

1.  Create a new file in an initialized Git repository called `example.txt`.
2.  Use `git add example.txt` to add this file.
3.  Use `git status` to check that Git has noticed it.
4.  Use `git rm --cached example.txt` to remove it from the list of things to be saved.

What does `git status` now show?
What (if anything) has happened to the file?

### Viewing changes {#git-cmdline-ex-word-diff}

Make a few changes to a file in a Git repository,
then view those differences using both `git diff`
and `git diff --word-diff`.
Which output do you find easiest to understand?

Note: If you performed this exercise in your Zipf's Law project,
we recommend discarding (not committing)
your changes made to a file.

### Committing changes {#git-cmdline-ex-commit}

Which command(s) below would save changes to `myfile.txt` to a local Git repository?

```bash
# Option 1
$ git commit -m "Add recent changes"
```

```bash
# Option 2
$ git init myfile.txt
$ git commit -m "Add recent changes"
```

```bash
# Option 3
$ git add myfile.txt
$ git commit -m "Add recent changes"
   ```

```bash
# Option 4
$ git commit -m myfile.txt "Add recent changes"
```

### Write your biography {#git-cmdline-ex-bio}

1.  Create a new Git repository on your computer called `bio`.
Make sure the directory containing this repository is outside your `zipf` project directory! 
2.  Write a three-line biography for yourself in a file called `me.txt` and commit your changes.
3.  Modify one line and add a fourth line.
4.  Display the differences between the file's original state and its updated state.

### Committing multiple files {#git-cmdline-ex-multiple}

The staging area can hold changes from any number of files
that you want to commit as a single snapshot.

From your new `bio` directory,
following after the previous exercise (wich leaves you with uncommitted changes to `me.txt`):

1.  Create another new file `employment.txt`
    and add the details of your most recent job.

2.  Add the new changes to both `me.txt` and `employment.txt` to the staging area
    and commit those changes.

### GitHub timestamps {#git-cmdline-ex-timestamp}

1.  Create a remote repository on GitHub for your new `bio` repository.
2.  Push the contents of your local repository to the remote.
3.  Make another change to your local repository
    (e.g., by editing `me.txt` or `employment.txt`)
    and push these changes as well.
4.  Go to the repo you just created on GitHub and check the timestamps of the files.

How does GitHub record times, and why?

### Workflow and history {#git-cmdline-ex-history}

Assume you made the following changes in your `bio` repository.
What is the output of the last command in the sequence below?

```bash
$ echo "Sharing information about myself." > motivation.txt
$ git add motivation.txt
$ echo "Documenting major milestones." > motivation.txt
$ git commit -m "Motivate project"
$ git restore motivation.txt
$ cat motivation.txt
```

1. `Sharing information about myself.`

2. `Documenting major milestones.`

3. 
```text
Sharing information about myself.
Documenting major milestones.
```

4. An error message because we have changed `motivation.txt` without committing first.

### Ignoring nested files {#git-cmdline-ex-ignore-nested}

Suppose our project has a directory `results` with two subdirectories called `data` and `plots`.
How would we ignore all of the files in `results/plots`
but not ignore files in `results/data`?

### Including specific files {#git-cmdline-ex-include}

How would you ignore all `.dat` files in your root directory except for `final.dat`?
(Hint: find out what the exclamation mark `!` means in a `.gitignore` file.)

### Exploring the GitHub interface {#git-cmdline-ex-github-interface}

Browse to your `zipf` repository on GitHub.
Under the `Code` tab,
find and click on the text that says "NN commits" (where "NN" is some number).
Hover over and click on the three buttons to the right of each commit.
What information can you gather/explore from these buttons?
How would you get that same information in the shell?

### Push versus commit {#git-cmdline-ex-push-commit}

Explain in one or two sentences how `git push` is different from `git commit`.

### License and README files {#git-cmdline-ex-boilerplate}

When we initialized our remote `zipf` GitHub repo,
we didn't add a `README.md` or license file.
If we had,
what would have happened when we tried to link our local and remote repositories?

### Recovering older versions of a file {#git-cmdline-ex-recover}

Amira made changes this morning to a shell script called `data_cruncher.sh`
that she has been working on for weeks.
Her changes broke the script,
and she has now spent an hour trying to get it back in working order.
Luckily,
she has been keeping track of her project's versions using Git.
Which of the commands below can she use
to recover the last committed version of her script?

1.  `$ git checkout HEAD`
2.  `$ git checkout HEAD data_cruncher.sh`
3.  `$ git checkout HEAD~1 data_cruncher.sh`
4.  `$ git checkout <unique ID of last commit> data_cruncher.sh`
5.  `$ git restore data_cruncher.sh`
6.  `$ git restore HEAD`

### Understanding `git diff` {#git-cmdline-ex-diff}

Using your `zipf` project directory:

1.  What would the command `git diff HEAD~9 bin/plotcounts.py` do if we run it?
2.  What does it actually do?
3.  What does `git diff HEAD bin/plotcounts.py` do?

### Getting rid of staged changes {#git-cmdline-ex-unstage}

`git checkout` can be used to restore a previous commit when unstaged changes have been made,
but will it also work for changes that have been staged but not committed?
To find out,
use your `zipf` project directory to:

1.  Change `bin/plotcounts.py`.
2.  Use `git add` on those changes to `bin/plotcounts.py`.
3.  Use `git checkout` to see if you can remove your change.

Does it work?

### Figuring out who did what {#git-cmdline-ex-blame}

We never committed the last edit that removes the calculation of inverse rank.
Remove this line from `plotcounts.py`,
then commit the change:

```python
df['inverse_rank'] = 1 / df['rank']
```

Run the command `git blame bin/plotcounts.py`.
What does each line of the output show?

## Key Points {#git-cmdline-keypoints}

```{r, child="keypoints/git-cmdline.md"}
```
