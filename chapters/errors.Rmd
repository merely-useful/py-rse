# Handling Errors {#errors}

We are imperfect people living in an imperfect world.
People will misunderstand how to use our programs,
and even if we test thoroughly using the techniques of Chapter \@ref(testing),
those programs might still contain bugs.
We should therefore plan from the start to detect and handle errors.

Something that goes wrong while a program is running
is sometimes referred to as an \gref{exception}{exception} from normal behavior.\index{exception}
Generally speaking,
we distinguish between \gref{internal errors}{internal_error},\index{error!internal}\index{internal error}
such as calling a function with `None` instead of a list,
and \gref{external errors}{external_error},
such as trying to read a file that doesn't exist.
Internal errors are mistakes in the program itself;
they should be prevented by doing unit testing,
but software is always used in new ways in the real world,
and those new ways can trigger unanticipated bugs.

When an internal error occurs,
the only thing we can do in most cases is report it and halt the program.
If a function has been passed `None` instead of a valid list,
for example,
the odds are good that one of our data structures is corrupted.
We can try to guess what the problem is and take corrective action,
but our guess will often be wrong
and our attempt to correct the problem might actually make things worse.

External errors,\index{error!external}\index{external error}
on the other hand,
are usually caused by interactions between the program and the outside world:
a user may mis-type a filename,
the network might be down,
and so on.
For example,
if a user mis-types her password,
prompting her to try again would be friendlier than
requiring her to restart the program.

No matter why an exception occurs,
the program should communicate the cause
so that the user can take the appropriate action to fix it.
Since some problems can't be resolved immediately,
the program should save error messages to a file
to aid troubleshooting and to share with other people when filing a bug.

## Exceptions {#errors-exceptions}

Most modern programming languages use \gref{exceptions}{exception} for error handling.
As the name suggests,
an exception is a way to represent an exceptional or unusual occurrence
that doesn't fit neatly into the program's expected operation.
The code below uses exceptions to report attempts to divide by zero:

```python
for denom in [-5, 0, 5]:
    try:
        result = 1/denom
        print(f'1/{denom} == {result}')
    except:
        print(f'Cannot divide by {denom}')
```

```text
1/-5 == -0.2
Cannot divide by 0
1/5 == 0.2
```

`try`/`except` looks like `if`/`else` and works in a similar fashion.
If nothing unexpected happens inside the `try` block,
the `except` block isn't run (Figure \@ref(fig:errors-control-flow)).
If something goes wrong inside the `try`,
on the other hand,
the program jumps immediately to the `except`.
This is why the `print` statement inside the `try` doesn't run when `denom` is 0:
as soon as Python tries to calculate `1/denom`,
it skips directly to the code under `except`.

```{r errors-control-flow, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Exception control flow.", out.width="40%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/errors/exceptions.png")
```

We often want to know exactly what went wrong,
so Python and other languages store information about the error
in an object (which is also called an exception).
We can \gref{catch}{catch_exception} an exception and inspect it as follows:\index{exception!catch}\index{catch exception}

```python
for denom in [-5, 0, 5]:
    try:
        result = 1/denom
        print(f'1/{denom} == {result}')
    except Exception as error:
        print(f'{denom} has no reciprocal: {error}')
```

```text
1/-5 == -0.2
0 has no reciprocal: division by zero
1/5 == 0.2
```

We can use any variable name we like instead of `error`;
Python will assign the exception object to that variable
so that we can do things with it in the `except` block.

Python also allows us to specify what kind of exception we want to catch.
For example,
we can write code to handle out-of-range indexing and division by zero separately:

```python
numbers = [-5, 0, 5]
for i in [0, 1, 2, 3]:
    try:
        denom = numbers[i]
        result = 1/denom
        print(f'1/{denom} == {result}')
    except IndexError as error:
        print(f'index {i} out of range')
    except ZeroDivisionError as error:
        print(f'{denom} has no reciprocal: {error}')
```

```text
1/-5 == -0.2
0 has no reciprocal: division by zero
1/5 == 0.2
index 3 out of range
```

Exceptions are organized in a hierarchy:\index{exception!hierarchy}
for example,
`FloatingPointError`, `OverflowError`, and `ZeroDivisionError`
are all special cases of `ArithmeticError`,
so an `except` that catches the latter will catch all three of the former,
but an `except` that catches an `OverflowError`
*won't* catch a `ZeroDivisionError`.
The Python documentation describes all of [the built-in exception types][python-exceptions];
in practice,
the ones that people handle most often are:

-   `ArithmeticError`:
    something has gone wrong in a calculation.
-   `IndexError` and `KeyError`:
    something has gone wrong indexing a list or lookup something up in a dictionary.
-   `OSError`:
    thrown when a file is not found,
    the program doesn't have permission to read it,
    and so on.

So where do exceptions come from?
The answer is that programmers can \gref{raise}{raise_exception} them explicitly:\index{exception!raise}\index{raise exception}

```python
for number in [1, 0, -1]:
    try:
        if number < 0:
            raise ValueError(f'no negatives: {number}')
        print(number)
    except ValueError as error:
        print(f'exception: {error}')
```

```text
1
0
exception: no negatives: -1
```

We can define our own exception types,
and many libraries do,
but the built-in types are enough to cover common cases.

One final note is that exceptions don't have to be handled where they are raised.
In fact,
their greatest strength is that they allow long-range error handling.
If an exception occurs inside a function and there is no `except` for it there,
Python checks to see if whoever called the function is willing to handle the error.
It keeps working its way up through the \gref{call stack}{call_stack}\index{call stack}
until it finds a matching `except`.
If there isn't one,
Python takes care of the exception itself.
The example below relies on this:
the second call to `sum_reciprocals` tries to divide by zero,
but the exception is caught in the calling code
rather than in the function.

```python
def sum_reciprocals(values):
    result = 0
    for v in values:
        result += 1/v
    return result

numbers = [-1, 0, 1]
try:
    one_over = sum_reciprocals(numbers)
except ArithmeticError as error:
    print(f'Error trying to sum reciprocals: {error}')
```

```text
Error trying to sum reciprocals: division by zero
```

This behavior is designed to support a pattern called "throw low, catch high":
write most of your code without exception handlers,
since there's nothing useful you can do in the middle of a small utility function,
but put a few handlers in the uppermost functions of your program
to catch and report all errors.

We can now go ahead and add error handling to our Zipf's Law code.
Some is already built in:
for example,
if we try to read a file that does not exist,
the `open` function throws a `FileNotFoundError`:

```bash
$ python bin/collate.py results/none.csv results/dracula.csv
```

```text
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "bin/collate.py", line 27, in <module>
    main(args)
  File "bin/collate.py", line 17, in main
    with open(fname, 'r') as reader:
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:
'results/none.csv'
```

But what happens if we try to read a file that exists,
but was not created by `countwords.py`?


```bash
$ python bin/collate.py Makefile
```

```text
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "bin/collate.py", line 27, in <module>
    main(args)
  File "bin/collate.py", line 18, in main
    update_counts(reader, word_counts)
  File "bin/collate.py", line 10, in update_counts
    for word, count in csv.reader(reader):
ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)
```

This error is hard to understand,
even if we are familiar with the code's internals.
Our program should therefore check that the input files are CSV files,
and if not,
raise an error with a useful explanation to what went wrong.
We could achieve this by wrapping the call to `open` in a `try/except` clause:

```python
for fname in args.infiles:
    try:
        with open(fname, 'r') as reader:
            update_counts(reader, word_counts)
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f'{fname} is not a CSV file.')
        print(f'ValueError: {e}')
```

```bash
$ python bin/collate.py Makefile
```

```text
Makefile is not a CSV file.
ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)
```

This is definitely more informative than before.
However,
*all* `ValueErrors` that are raised when trying to open a file
will result in this error message,
including those raised when we actually do use a CSV file as input.
A more precise approach in this case would be to throw an exception
only if some other kind of file is specified as an input:

```python
for fname in args.infiles:
    if fname[-4:] != '.csv':
        raise OSError(f'{fname} is not a CSV file.')
    with open(fname, 'r') as reader:
        update_counts(reader, word_counts)
```

```bash
$ python bin/collate.py Makefile
```

```text
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "bin/collate.py", line 29, in <module>
    main(args)
  File "bin/collate.py", line 18, in main
    raise OSError(f'{fname} is not a CSV file.')
OSError: Makefile is not a CSV file.
```

This approach is still not perfect:
we are checking that the file's suffix is `.csv`
instead of checking the content of the file
and confirming that it is what we require.
What we *should* do is check that there are two columns separated by a comma,
that the first column contains strings,
and that the second is numerical.

## Writing Useful Error Messages {#errors-messages}

The error message shown in Figure \@ref(fig:errors-error-message) is not helpful:\index{error message!writing helpful}

```{r errors-error-message, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="An unhelpful error message.", out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/scripting/error-message.png")
```

Having `collate.py` print the message below would be equally unfriendly:

```text
OSError: Something went wrong, try again.
```

This message doesn't provide any information on what went wrong,
so it is difficult to know what to change for next time.
A slightly better message would be:

```text
OSError: Unsupported file type.
```

This tells us the problem is with the type of file we're trying to process,
but it still doesn't tell us what file types are supported,
which means we have to rely on guesswork or read the source code.
Telling the user "*filename* is not a CSV file"
(as we did in the previous section)
makes it clear that the program only works with CSV files,
but since we don't actually check the content of the file,
this message could confuse someone who has comma-separated values saved in a `.txt` file.
An even better message would therefore be:

```text
OSError: File must end in .csv
```

This message tells us exactly what the criteria are to avoid the error.

Error messages are often the first thing people read about a piece of software,
so they should therefore be the most carefully written documentation for that software.
A web search for "writing good error messages" turns up hundreds of hits,
but recommendations are often more like gripes than guidelines
and are usually not backed up by evidence.
What research there is gives us the following rules [@Beck2016]:

1.  Tell the user what they did, not what the program did.
    Putting it another way,
    the message shouldn't state the effect of the error,
    it should state the cause.

2.  Be spatially correct,
    i.e.,
    point at the actual location of the error.
    Few things are as frustrating as being pointed at line 28
    when the problem is really on line 35.

3.  Be as specific as possible without being or seeming wrong
    from a user's point of view.
    For example,
    "file not found" is very different from "don't have permissions to open file" or "file is empty".

4.  Write for your audience's level of understanding.
    For example,
    error messages should never use programming terms more advanced than
    those you would use to describe the code to the user.

5.  Do not blame the user, and do not use words like fatal, illegal, etc.
    The former can be frustrating---in many cases, "user error" actually isn't---and
    the latter can make people worry that the program has damaged their data,
    their computer,
    or their reputation.

6.  Do not try to make the computer sound like a human being.
    In particular, avoid humor:
    very few jokes are funny on the dozenth re-telling,
    and most users are going to see error messages at least that often.

7.  Use a consistent vocabulary.
    This rule can be hard to enforce when error messages are written by several different people,
    but putting them all in one module makes review easier.

That last suggestion deserves a little elaboration.\index{error message!lookup table}
Most people write error messages directly in their code:

```python
if fname[-4:] != '.csv':
    raise OSError(f'{fname}: File must end in .csv')
```

A better approach is to put all the error messages in a dictionary:

```python
ERRORS = {
    'not_csv_suffix' : '{fname}: File must end in .csv',
    'config_corrupted' : '{config_name} corrupted',
    # ...more error messages...
    }
```

and then only use messages from that dictionary:

```python
if fname[-4:] != '.csv':
    raise OSError(ERRORS['not_csv_suffix'].format(fname=fname))
```

Doing this makes it much easier to ensure that messages are consistent.
It also makes it much easier to give messages in the user's preferred language:

```python
ERRORS = {
  'en' : {
    'not_csv_suffix' : '{fname}: File must end in .csv',
    'config_corrupted' : '{config_name} corrupted',
    # ...more error messages in English...
  },
  'fr' : {
    'not_csv_suffix' : '{fname}: Doit se terminer par .csv',
    'config_corrupted' : f'{config_name} corrompu',
    # ...more error messages in French...
  }
  # ...other languages...
}
```

The error report is then looked up and formatted as:

```python
ERRORS[user_language]['not_csv_suffix'].format(fname=fname)
```

where `user_language` is a two-letter code for the user's preferred language.

## Testing Error Handling {#errors-testing}

An alarm isn't much use if it doesn't go off when it's supposed to.
Equally,
if a function doesn't raise an exception when it should
then errors can easily slip past us.
If we want to check that a function called `func`
raises an `ExpectedError` exception\index{testing!error handling}\index{exception!testing}
we can use the following template for a unit test:

```python
#...set up fixture...
try:
    actual = func(fixture)
    assert False, 'Expected function to raise exception'
except ExpectedError as error:
    pass
except Exception as error:
    assert False, 'Function raised the wrong exception'
```

This template has three cases:

1.  If the call to `func` returns a value without throwing an exception
    then something has gone wrong,
    so we `assert False` (which always fails).

2.  If `func` raises the error it's supposed to
    then we go into the first `except` branch
    *without* triggering the `assert` immediately below the function call.
    The code in this `except` branch could check that
    the exception contains the right error message,
    but in this case it does nothing
    (which in Python is written `pass`).

3.  Finally,
    if the function raises the wrong kind of exception
    we also `assert False`.
    Checking this case might seem overly cautious,
    but if the function raises the wrong kind of exception,
    users could easily fail to catch it.

This pattern is so common that `pytest` provides support for it.
Instead of the eight lines in our original example,
we can write:

```python
import pytest


#...set up fixture...
with pytest.raises(ExpectedError):
    actual = func(fixture)
```

The argument to `pytest.raises` is the type of exception we expect;
the call to the function then goes in the body of the `with` statement.
We will explore `pytest.raises` further in the exercises.

## Reporting Errors {#errors-logging}

Programs should report things that go wrong;\index{error message!reporting}
they should also sometimes report things that go right
so that people can monitor their progress.
Adding `print` statements is a common approach,
but removing them or commenting them out when the code goes into production is tedious and error-prone.

A better approach is to use a \gref{logging framework}{logging_framework},\index{logging framework}
such as Python's `logging` library.
This lets us leave debugging statements in our code
and turn them on or off at will.
It also lets us send output to any of several destinations,
which is helpful when our data analysis pipeline has several stages
and we are trying to figure out which one contains a bug.

To understand how logging frameworks work,
suppose we want to turn `print` statements in our `collate.py` program on or off
without editing the program's source code.
We would probably wind up with code like this:

```python
if LOG_LEVEL >= 0:
    print('Processing files...')
for fname in args.infiles:
    if LOG_LEVEL >= 1:
        print(f'Reading in {fname}...')
    if fname[-4:] != '.csv':
        msg = ERRORS['not_csv_suffix'].format(fname=fname)
        raise OSError(msg)
    with open(fname, 'r') as reader:
        if LOG_LEVEL >= 1:
            print(f'Computing word counts...')
        update_counts(reader, word_counts)
```

`LOG_LEVEL` acts as a threshold:
any debugging output at a lower level than its value isn't printed.
As a result,
the first log message will always be printed,
but the other two only in case the user has requested more details
by setting `LOG_LEVEL` higher than zero.

A logging framework combines the `if` and `print` statements in a single function call
and defines standard names for the \gref{logging levels}{logging_level}.\index{logging level}
In order of increasing severity,
the usual levels are:

-   `DEBUG`: very detailed information used for localizing errors.
-   `INFO`: confirmation that things are working as expected.
-   `WARNING`: something unexpected happened, but the program will keep going.
-   `ERROR`: something has gone badly wrong, but the program hasn't hurt anything.
-   `CRITICAL`: potential loss of data, security breach, etc.

Each of these has a corresponding function:
we can use `logging.debug`, `logging.info`, etc. to write messages at these levels.
By default,
only `WARNING` and above are displayed;
messages appear on \gref{standard error}{stderr}\index{standard error}
so that the flow of data in pipes isn't affected.
The logging framework also displays the source of the message,
which is called `root` by default.
Thus,
if we run the small program shown below,
only the warning message appears:

```python
import logging


logging.warning('This is a warning.')
logging.info('This is just for information.')
```

```text
WARNING:root:This is a warning.
```

Rewriting the `collate.py` example above using `logging`
yields code that is less cluttered:

```python
import logging


logging.info('Processing files...')
for fname in args.infiles:
    logging.debug(f'Reading in {fname}...')
    if fname[-4:] != '.csv':
        msg = ERRORS['not_csv_suffix'].format(fname=fname)
        raise OSError(msg)
    with open(fname, 'r') as reader:
        logging.debug('Computing word counts...')
        update_counts(reader, word_counts)
```

We can also configure logging to send messages to a file
instead of standard error\index{configuration!logging}\index{logging configuration}
using `logging.basicConfig`.
(This has to be done before we make any logging calls---it's not retroactive.)
We can also use that function to set the logging level:
everything at or above the specified level is displayed.

```python
import logging


logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, filename='logging.log')

logging.debug('This is for debugging.')
logging.info('This is just for information.')
logging.warning('This is a warning.')
logging.error('Something went wrong.')
logging.critical('Something went seriously wrong.')
```

```text
DEBUG:root:This is for debugging.
INFO:root:This is just for information.
WARNING:root:This is a warning.
ERROR:root:Something went wrong.
CRITICAL:root:Something went seriously wrong.
```

By default,
`basicConfig` re-opens the file we specify in \gref{append mode}{append_mode};\index{append mode}
we can use `filemode='w'` to overwrite the existing log data.
Overwriting is useful during debugging,
but we should think twice before doing in production,
since the information we throw away often turns out to be
exactly what we need to find a bug.

Many programs allow users to specify logging levels and log file names as command-line parameters.
At its simplest,
this is a single flag `-v` or `--verbose` that changes the logging level from `WARNING` (the default)
to `DEBUG` (the noisiest level).
There may also be a corresponding flag `-q` or `--quiet` that changes the level to `ERROR`,
and a flag `-l` or `--logfile` that specifies a log file name.
To log messages to a file while also printing them,
we can tell `logging` to use two handlers simultaneously:

```python
import logging


logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler("logging.log"),
        logging.StreamHandler()])

logging.debug('This is for debugging.')
```

The string `'This is for debugging'` is both printed to standard error
and appended to `logging.log`.

Libraries like `logging` can send messages to many destinations;
in production,
we might send them to a centralized logging server
that collates logs from many different systems.
We might also use \gref{rotating files}{rotating_file}\index{logging framework!rotating file}
so that the system always has messages from the last few hours
but doesn't fill up the disk.
We don't need any of these when we start,
but the data engineers and system administrators
who eventually have to install and maintain your programs
will be very grateful if we use `logging` instead of `print` statements,
because it allows them to set things up the way they want with very little work.

## Summary {#errors-summary}

Most programmers spend as much time debugging as they do writing new code,
but most courses and textbooks only show working code,
and never discuss how to prevent, diagnose, report, and handle errors.
Raising our own exceptions instead of using the system's,
writing useful error messages,
and logging problems systematically
can save us and our users a lot of needless work.

Some of the following exercises will ask you to make further edits to `collate.py`.

### Set the logging level {#errors-ex-set-level}

Define a new command line flag for `collate.py` called `--verbose` (or `-v`)
that changes the logging level from `WARNING` (the default)
to `DEBUG` (the noisiest level).

Hint: the following command changes the logging level to `DEBUG`:

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

Once finished,
running `collate.py` with and without the `-v` flag should produce the following output:

```bash
$ python bin/collate.py results/dracula.csv results/moby_dick.csv
  -n 5
```
```text
the,22559
and,12306
of,10446
to,9192
a,7629
```

```bash
$ python bin/collate.py results/dracula.csv results/moby_dick.csv
  -n 5 -v
```
```text
INFO:root:Processing files...
DEBUG:root:Reading in results/dracula.csv...
DEBUG:root:Computing word counts...
DEBUG:root:Reading in results/moby_dick.csv...
DEBUG:root:Computing word counts...
the,22559
and,12306
of,10446
to,9192
a,7629
```

### Send the logging output to file {#errors-ex-logging-output}

In Exercise \@ref(errors-ex-set-level),
logging information is printed to the screen when the verbose flag is activated.
This is problematic if we want to re-direct the output from `collate.py` to a CSV file,
because the logging information will appear in the CSV file
as well as the words and their counts.

1. Edit `collate.py` so that the logging information is sent to a log file
called `collate.log` instead.
(HINT: `logging.basicConfig` has an argument called `filename`.)

2. Create a new command line option `-l` or `--logfile` so that the user
can specify a different name for the log file if they don't like
the default name of `collate.log`.

### Handling exceptions {#errors-ex-exceptions}

1.  Modify the script `collate.py` so that it catches any exceptions
    that are raised when it tries to open files
    and records them in the log file.
    When you are finished,
    the program should collate all the files it can
    rather than halting as soon as it encounters a problem.
2.  Modify your first solution to handle nonexistent files
    and permission problems separately.

### Testing error handling {#errors-ex-error-handling}

In our suggested solution to the previous exercise we modified `collate.py` to handle
different types of errors associated with reading input files.
The `main` function in `collate.py` now reads:

```python
def main(args):
    """Run the command line program."""
    log_lev = logging.DEBUG if args.verbose else logging.WARNING
    logging.basicConfig(level=log_lev, filename=args.logfile)
    word_counts = Counter()
    logging.info('Processing files...')
    for fname in args.infiles:
        try:
            logging.debug(f'Reading in {fname}...')
            if fname[-4:] != '.csv':
                msg = util.ERRORS['not_csv_suffix'].format(
                      fname=fname)
                raise OSError(msg)
            with open(fname, 'r') as reader:
                logging.debug('Computing word counts...')
                update_counts(reader, word_counts)
        except FileNotFoundError:
            msg = f'{fname} not processed: File does not exist'
            logging.warning(msg)
        except PermissionError:
            msg = f'{fname} not processed: No permission to read'
            logging.warning(msg)
        except Exception as error:
            msg = f'{fname} not processed: {error}'
            logging.warning(msg)
    util.collection_to_csv(word_counts, num=args.num)

```

1.  It is difficult to write a simple unit test for the lines of code dedicated
    to reading input files, because `main` is a long function that requires
    command line arguments as input.  Edit `collate.py` so that the six lines of
    code responsible for processing an input file appear in their own function
    that reads as follows (i.e. once you are done, `main` should call
    `process_file` in place of the existing code):

```python
def process_file(fname, word_counts):
    """Read file and update word counts"""
    logging.debug(f'Reading in {fname}...')
    if fname[-4:] != '.csv':
        msg = util.ERRORS['not_csv_suffix'].format(fname=fname)
        raise OSError(msg)
    with open(fname, 'r') as reader:
        logging.debug('Computing word counts...')
        update_counts(reader, word_counts)
```

2.  Add a unit test to `test_zipfs.py` that uses `pytest.raises` to check that
    the new `collate.process_file` function raises an `OSError` if the input
    file does not end in `.csv`.  Run `pytest` to check that the new test
    passes.

3.  Add a unit test to `test_zipfs.py` that uses `pytest.raises` to check that
    the new `collate.process_file` function raises a `FileNotFoundError` if the
    input file does not exist.  Run `pytest` to check that the new test passes.

4.  Use the `coverage` library (Section \@ref(testing-coverage)) to check that
    the relevant commands in `process_file` (specifically `raise OSError` and
    `open(fname, 'r')`) were indeed tested.

### Error catalogs {#errors-ex-catalog}

In Section \@ref(errors-messages) we started to define an error catalog called `ERRORS`.

1. Read Appendix \@ref(style-pep8) and explain why we have used capital letters
   for the name of the catalog.
2. Python has three ways to format strings:
   the `%` operator, the `str.format` method, and f-strings (where the "f" stands for "format").
   Look up the documentation for each
   and explain why we have to use `str.format` rather than f-strings
   for formatting error messages in our catalog/lookup table.
3. There's a good chance we will eventually want to use the error messages we've defined
   in other scripts besides `collate.py`.
   To avoid duplication,
   move `ERRORS` to the `utilities` module that was first created in
   Section \@ref(py-rse-py-scripting-modules).

### Tracebacks {#errors-ex-traceback}

Run the following code:

```python
try:
    1/0
except Exception as e:
    help(e.__traceback__)
```

1.  What kind of object is `e.__traceback__`?
2.  What useful information can you get from it?

## Key Points {#errors-keypoints}

```{r, child="keypoints/errors.md"}
```
