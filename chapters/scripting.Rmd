# Building Command-Line Tools with Python {#scripting}

The [Jupyter Notebook][jupyter], PyCharm, and other graphical interfaces
are great for prototyping code and exploring data,
but eventually we may need to apply our code to thousands of data files,
run it with many different parameters,
or combine it with other programs as part of a data analysis pipeline.
The easiest way to do this is often
to turn our code into a standalone program that can be run in the Unix shell
just like other command-line tools [@Tasc2017].

In this chapter we will develop some command-line Python programs\index{Python!command line}
that handle input and output in the same way as other shell commands,
can be controlled by several option flags,
and provide useful information when things go wrong.
The result will have more scaffolding than useful application code,
but that scaffolding stays more or less the same as programs get larger.

After the previous chapters,
our Zipf's Law project should have the following files and directories:

## Programs and Modules {#scripting-main}

To create a Python program that can run from the command line,\index{Python!program vs.\ module}
the first thing we do is to add the following to the bottom of the file:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
```

This strange-looking check tells us
whether the file is running as a standalone program
or whether it is being imported as a module by some other program.
When we import a Python file as a module in another program,
the `__name__` variable is automatically set to the name of the file.\index{\_\_name\_\_ variable (in Python)}\index{Python!\_\_name\_\_ variable}
When we run a Python file as a standalone program,
on the other hand,
`__name__` is always set to the special string `"__main__"`.
To illustrate this,
let's consider a script named `print_name.py`
that prints the value of the `__name__` variable:

```python
print(__name__)
```

When we run this file directly,
it will print `__main__`:

```bash
$ python print_name.py
```

```text
__main__
```

But if we import `print_name.py` from another file
or from the Python interpreter,
it will print the name of the file,
i.e., `print_name`.

```bash
$ python
```
```text
Python 3.7.6 (default, Jan  8 2020, 13:42:34) 
[Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)] :: 
Anaconda, Inc. on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license"
for more information.
```
```python
>>> import print_name
```
```text
print_name
```

Checking the value of the variable `__name__`
therefore tells us whether our file is the top-level program or not.
If it is,
we can handle command-line options, print help, or whatever else is appropriate;
if it isn't,
we should assume that some other code is doing this.

We could put the main program code directly under the `if` statement like this:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # code goes here
```

but that is considered poor practice,
since it makes testing harder (Chapter \@ref(testing)).
Instead,
we put the high-level logic in a function,
then call that function if our file is being run directly:

```python
def main():
    # code goes here


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This top-level function is usually called `main`,
but we can use whatever name we want.

## Handling Command-Line Options {#scripting-options}

The main function in a program usually starts by
parsing any options the user gave on the command line.\index{option (of Python program)}\index{Python!option}
The most commonly used library for doing this in Python is [`argparse`][argparse],
which can handle options with or without arguments,
convert arguments from strings to numbers or other types,
display help,
and many other things.

The simplest way to explain how `argparse` works is by example.
Let's create a short Python program called `script_template.py`:

```python
import argparse


def main(args):
    print('Input file:', args.infile)
    print('Output file:', args.outfile)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    USAGE = 'One-line description of what the script does.'
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=USAGE)
    parser.add_argument('infile', type=str,
                        help='Input file name')
    parser.add_argument('outfile', type=str,
                        help='Output file name')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    main(args)
```

> **Empty Lines, Again**
> 
> As we discussed in the last chapter for shell scripts,
> remember to end your Python scripts in a newline character
> (which we view as an empty line).\index{whitespace}

If `script_template.py` is run as a standalone program at the command line,
then `__name__ == '__main__'` is true,
so the program uses `argparse` to create an argument parser.
It then specifies that it expects two command-line arguments:
an input filename (`infile`) and an output filename (`outfile`).
The program uses `parser.parse_args()` to parse the actual command-line arguments given by the user
and stores the result in a variable called `args`,
which it passes to `main`.
That function can then get the values using the names specified
in the `parser.add_argument` calls.

> **Specifying Types**
>
> We have passed `type=str` to `add_argument` to tell `argparse` that
> we want `infile` and `outfile` to be treated as strings.
> `str` is not quoted because it is not a string itself:
> instead,
> it is the built-in Python function that converts things to strings.
> As we will see below,
> we can pass in other functions like `int`
> if we want arguments converted to numbers.

If we run `script_template.py` at the command line,
the output shows us that `argparse` has successfully handled the arguments:

```bash
$ cd ~/zipf
$ python script_template.py in.csv out.png
```

```text
Input file: in.csv
Output file: out.png
```

It also displays an error message if we give the program invalid arguments:

```bash
$ python script_template.py in.csv
```

```text
usage: script_template.py [-h] infile outfile
script_template.py: error: the following arguments are
  required: outfile
```

Finally,
it automatically generates help information
(which we can get using the `-h` option):

```bash
$ python script_template.py -h
```

```text
usage: script_template.py [-h] infile outfile

One-line description of what the script does.

positional arguments:
  infile      Input file name
  outfile     Output file name

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

## Documentation {#scripting-docstrings}

Our program template is a good starting point,
but we improve it right away
by adding a bit of documentation.\index{Python!documenting}
To demonstrate,
let's write a function that doubles a number:

```python
def double(num):
    'Double the input.'
    return 2 * num
```

The first line of this function is a string
that isn't assigned to a variable.
Such a string is called a documentation string,
or \gref{docstring}{docstring} for short.\index{docstring (in Python)}\index{Python!docstring}
If we call our function it does what we expect:

```python
double(3)
```

```text
6
```

However,
we can also ask for the function's documentation,
which is stored in `double.__doc__`:\index{\_\_doc\_\_ variable (in Python)}

```python
double.__doc__
```

```text
'Double the input.'
```

Python creates the variable `__doc__` automatically for every function,
just as it creates the variable `__name__` for every file.
If we don't write a docstring for a function,
`__doc__`'s value is an empty string.
We can put whatever text we want into a function's docstring,
but it is usually used to provide online documentation.

We can also put a docstring at the start of a file,
in which case it is assigned to a variable called `__doc__`
that is visible inside the file.
If we add documentation to our template,
it becomes:

```python
"""One-line description of what the script does."""

import argparse


def main(args):
    """Run the program."""
    print('Input file:', args.infile)
    print('Output file:', args.outfile)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=__doc__)
    parser.add_argument('infile', type=str,
                        help='Input file name')
    parser.add_argument('outfile', type=str,
                        help='Output file name')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    main(args)
```

Note that docstrings are usually written using triple-quoted strings,\index{Python!triple-quoted strings}
since these can span multiple lines.
Note also how we pass `description=__doc__` to `argparse.ArgumentParser`.
This saves us from typing the same information twice,
but more importantly ensures that
the help message provided in response to the `-h` option
will be the same as the interactive help.

Let's try this out in an interactive Python session.
(Remember, do not type the `>>>` prompt:
Python provides this for us.)

```bash
$ python
```
```text
Python 3.7.6 (default, Jan  8 2020, 13:42:34) 
[Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)] :: 
Anaconda, Inc. on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license"
for more information.
```
```python
>>> import script_template
>>> script_template.__doc__
```
```text
'One-line description of what the script does.'
```
```python
>>> help(script_template)
```
```text
Help on module script_template:

NAME
    script_template - One-line description of what the script does.

FUNCTIONS
    main(args)
        Run the program.

FILE
    /Users/amira/script_template.py
```

As this example shows,
if we ask for help on the module,
Python formats and displays all of the docstrings for everything in the file.
We talk more about what to put in a docstring in Appendix \@ref(documentation).

## Counting Words {#scripting-wordcount}

Now that we have a template for command-line Python programs,
we can use it to check Zipf's Law for our collection of classic novels.
We start by moving the template into the directory
where we store our runnable programs (Section \@ref(getting-started-organize)):

```bash
$ mv script_template.py bin
```

Next,
let's write a function that counts how often words appear in a file.
Our function splits the text on \gref{whitespace}{whitespace} characters
(which is the default behavior of the string object's `split` method),
then strips leading and trailing punctuation.
This isn't completely correct---if two words are joined by a long dash
like "correct" and "if" in this sentence, for example,
they will be treated as one word---but given that long dashes are used relatively infrequently,
it's close enough to correct for our purposes.
(We will submit a bug report about the long dash issue in Section \@ref(teams-bugs)).
We also use the `Counter` class from the `collections` library
to count how many times each word occurs.
If we give `Counter` a list of words,
the result is an object that contains
the number of times each one appears in the list:

```python
import string
from collections import Counter


def count_words(reader):
    """Count the occurrence of each word in a string."""
    text = reader.read()
    chunks = text.split()
    npunc = [word.strip(string.punctuation) for word in chunks] 
    word_list = [word.lower() for word in npunc if word]
    word_counts = Counter(word_list)
    return word_counts
```

Let's try our function on *Dracula*:

```python
with open('data/dracula.txt', 'r') as reader:
    word_counts = count_words(reader)
print(word_counts)
```

```text
Counter({'the': 8036, 'and': 5896, 'i': 4712, 'to': 4540,
         'of': 3738, 'a': 2961, 'in': 2558, 'he': 2543,
         'that': 2455, 'it': 2141, 'was': 1877, 'as': 1581,
         'we': 1535, 'for': 1534, ...})
```

If we want the word counts in a format like CSV for easier processing,
we can write another small function that takes our `Counter` object,
orders its contents from most to least frequent,
and then writes it to \gref{standard output}{stdout} as CSV:

```python
import sys
import csv


def collection_to_csv(collection):
    """Write collection of items and counts in csv format."""
    collection = collection.most_common()
    writer = csv.writer(sys.stdout)
    writer.writerows(collection)
```

Running this would print all the distinct words in the book
along with their counts.
This list could well be several thousand lines long,
so to make the output a little easier to view on our screen,
we can add an option to limit the output to the most frequent words.
We set its default value to `None`
so that we can easily tell if the caller *hasn't* specified a cutoff,
in which case we display the whole collection:

```python
def collection_to_csv(collection, num=None):
    """Write collection of items and counts in csv format."""
    collection = collection.most_common()
    if num is None:
        num = len(collection)
    writer = csv.writer(sys.stdout)
    writer.writerows(collection[0:num])
```

```python
collection_to_csv(word_counts, num=10)
```

```text
the,8036
and,5896
i,4712
to,4540
of,3738
a,2961
in,2558
he,2543
that,2455
it,2141
```

\newpage

To make our `count_words` and `collection_to_csv` functions available at the command line,
we need to insert them into our script template
and call them from within the `main` function.
Let's call our program `countwords.py`
and put it in the `bin` subdirectory of the `zipf` project:

```python
"""
Count the occurrences of all words in a text
and output them in CSV format.
"""

import sys
import argparse
import string
import csv
from collections import Counter


def collection_to_csv(collection, num=None):
    """Write collection of items and counts in csv format."""
    collection = collection.most_common()
    if num is None:
        num = len(collection)
    writer = csv.writer(sys.stdout)
    writer.writerows(collection[0:num])


def count_words(reader):
    """Count the occurrence of each word in a string."""
    text = reader.read()
    chunks = text.split()
    npunc = [word.strip(string.punctuation) for word in chunks]
    word_list = [word.lower() for word in npunc if word]
    word_counts = Counter(word_list)
    return word_counts


def main(args):
    """Run the command line program."""
    with open(args.infile, 'r') as reader:
        word_counts = count_words(reader)
    collection_to_csv(word_counts, num=args.num)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=__doc__)
    parser.add_argument('infile', type=str,
                        help='Input file name')
    parser.add_argument('-n', '--num',
                        type=int, default=None,
                        help='Output n most frequent words')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    main(args)
```

Note that we have replaced the `'outfile'` argument from our template script
with an optional `-n` (or `--num`) flag to control how much output is printed
and modified `collection_to_csv` so that it always prints to standard output.
If we want that output in a file,
we can redirect with `>`.

Let's take our program for a test drive:

```bash
$ python bin/countwords.py data/dracula.txt -n 10
```

```text
the,8036
and,5896
i,4712
to,4540
of,3738
a,2961
in,2558
he,2543
that,2455
it,2141
```

## Pipelining {#scripting-pipeline}

As discussed in Section \@ref(bash-tools-stdio),
most Unix commands follow a useful convention:
if the user doesn't specify the names of any input files,
they read from \gref{standard input}{stdin}.\index{standard input!in Python}
Similarly,
if no output file is specified,
the command sends its results to \gref{standard output}{stdout}.
This makes it easy to use the command in a pipeline.

Our program always sends its output to standard output;\index{standard output!in Python}
as noted above,
we can always redirect it to a file with `>`.
If we want `countwords.py` to read from standard input,
we only need to change the handling of `infile` in the argument parser
and simplify `main` to match:

```python
def main(args):
    """Run the command line program."""
    word_counts = count_words(args.infile)
    collection_to_csv(word_counts, num=args.num)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=__doc__)
    parser.add_argument('infile', type=argparse.FileType('r'),
                        nargs='?', default='-',
                        help='Input file name')
    parser.add_argument('-n', '--num',
                        type=int, default=None,
                        help='Output n most frequent words')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    main(args)
```

There are two changes to how `add_argument` handles `infile`:

1.  Setting `type=argparse.FileType('r')`
    tells `argparse` to treat the argument as a filename
    and open that file for reading.
    This is why we no longer need to call `open` ourselves,
    and why `main` can pass `args.infile` directly to `count_words`.

2.  The number of expected arguments (`nargs`) is set to `?`.
    This means that if an argument is given it will be used,
    but if none is provided,
    a default of `'-'` will be used instead.
    `argparse.FileType('r')` understands `'-'` to mean "read from standard input";
    this is another Unix convention that many programs follow.

After these changes,
we can create a pipeline like this
to count the words in the first 500 lines of a book:

```bash
$ head -n 500 data/dracula.txt | python bin/countwords.py --n 10
```

```text
the,227
and,121
of,116
i,98
to,80
in,58
a,49
it,45
was,42
that,41
```

## Positional and Optional Arguments {#scripting-positional-optional}

We have met two kinds of command-line arguments while writing `countwords.py`.
\gref{Optional arguments}{optional_argument}\index{option (of shell command)!optional}
are defined using a leading `-` or `--` (or both),
which means that all three of the following definitions are valid:

```python
parser.add_argument('-n', type=int, help='Limit output')
parser.add_argument('--num', type=int, help='Limit output')
parser.add_argument('-n', '--num',
                    type=int, help='Limit output')
```

The convention is for `-` to precede
a \gref{short}{short_option} (single letter) option\index{option (of shell command)!short}
and `--` a \gref{long}{long_option} (multi-letter) option.\index{option (of shell command)!long}
The user can provide optional arguments at the command line in any order they like.

\gref{Positional arguments}{positional_argument}\index{positional argument (of program)}
have no leading dashes and are not optional:
the user must provide them at the command line
in the order in which they are specified to `add_argument`
(unless `nargs='?'` is provided to say that the value is optional).

## Collating Results {#scripting-collate}

Ultimately,
we want to save the word counts to a CSV file for further analysis and plotting.
Let's create a subdirectory to hold our results
(following the structure described in Section \@ref(getting-started-structure)):

```bash
$ mkdir results
```

and then save the counts for various files:

```bash
$ python bin/countwords.py data/dracula.txt > results/dracula.csv
```

```bash
$ python bin/countwords.py data/moby_dick.txt >
  results/moby_dick.csv
```

```bash
$ python bin/countwords.py data/jane_eyre.txt >
  results/jane_eyre.csv
```

As in the previous chapter,
we've split long lines of code onto separate lines for formatting purposes;
each of the three code chunks above should be run as a single line of code.

Now that we can get word counts for individual books
we can collate the counts for several books.
This can be done using a loop that adds up the counts of a word
from each of the CSV files created by `countwords.py`.
Using the same template as before,
we can write a program called `collate.py`:

```python
"""
Combine multiple word count CSV-files
into a single cumulative count.
"""

import sys
import csv
import argparse
from collections import Counter


def collection_to_csv(collection, num=None):
    """Write collection of items and counts in csv format."""
    collection = collection.most_common()
    if num is None:
        num = len(collection)
    writer = csv.writer(sys.stdout)
    writer.writerows(collection[0:num])


def update_counts(reader, word_counts):
    """Update word counts with data from another reader/file."""
    for word, count in csv.reader(reader):
        word_counts[word] += int(count)


def main(args):
    """Run the command line program."""
    word_counts = Counter()
    for fname in args.infiles:
        with open(fname, 'r') as reader:
            update_counts(reader, word_counts)
    collection_to_csv(word_counts, num=args.num)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=__doc__)
    parser.add_argument('infiles', type=str, nargs='*',
                        help='Input file names')
    parser.add_argument('-n', '--num',
                        type=int, default=None,
                        help='Output n most frequent words')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    main(args)
```

The loop in the `main` function iterates over each filename in `infiles`,
opens the CSV file,
and calls `update_counts` with the input stream as one parameter
and the counter as the other.
`update_counts` then iterates through all the words in the CSV files
and increments the counts using the `+=` operator.

Note that we have not used `type=argparse.FileType('r')` here.
Instead,
we have called the option `infiles` (plural)
and specified `nargs='*'`
to tell `argparse` that we will accept zero or more filenames.
We must then open the files ourselves.

Let's give `collate.py` a try
(using `-n 10` to limit the number of lines of output):

```bash
$ python bin/collate.py results/dracula.csv
  results/moby_dick.csv results/jane_eyre.csv -n 10
```

\newpage

```text

i,13572

it,6821
he,6142
```

## Writing Our Own Modules {#scripting-modules}

`countwords.py` and `collate.py` both now contain the function `collection_to_csv`.
Having the same function in two or more places is a bad idea:
if we want to improve it or fix a bug,
we have to find and change every single script that contains a copy.

The solution is to put the shared functions in a separate file
and load that file as a module.\index{Python!module}\index{module (in Python)}
Let's create a file called `utilities.py` in the `bin` directory
that looks like this:

```python
"""Collection of commonly used functions."""

import sys
import csv


def collection_to_csv(collection, num=None):
    """
    Write out collection of items and counts in csv format.

    Parameters
    ----------
    collection : collections.Counter
        Collection of items and counts
    num : int
        Limit output to N most frequent items
    """
    collection = collection.most_common()
    if num is None:
        num = len(collection)
    writer = csv.writer(sys.stdout)
    writer.writerows(collection[0:num])
```

Note that we have written a much more detailed docstring for `collection_to_csv`:
as a rule,
the more widely used code is,
the more it's worth explaining exactly what it does.

We can now import our utilities into our programs
just as we would import any other Python module
using either `import utilities` (to get the whole thing)
or something like `from utilities import collection_to_csv` (to get a single function).
After making this change,
`countwords.py` looks like this:

```python
"""
Count the occurrences of all words in a text
and write them to a CSV-file.
"""

import argparse
import string
from collections import Counter

import utilities as util


def count_words(reader):
    """Count the occurrence of each word in a string."""
    text = reader.read()

Any Python source file can be imported by any other.
This is why Python files should be named using \gref{snake case}{snake_case}\index{snake case}\index{naming conventions!snake case}
(e.g., `some_thing`)
instead of \gref{kebab case}{kebab_case}\index{kebab case}\index{naming conventions!kebab case}
(e.g., `some-thing`):
an expression like `import some-thing` isn't allowed
because `some-thing` isn't a legal variable name.
When a file is imported,
the statements in it are executed as it loads.
Variables, functions, and items defined in the file are then available as `module.thing`,
where `module` is the filename (without the `.py` extension)
and `thing` is the name of the item.

> When we import a file,
> Python translates the source code into instructions called \gref{byte codes}{byte_code}\index{byte code}
> that it can execute efficiently.
> Since the byte codes only change when the source changes,
> Python saves the byte code in a separate file,
> and reloads that file instead of re-translating the source code
> the next time it's asked to import the file
> (unless the file has changed,
> in which case Python starts from the beginning).
>
> Python creates a subdirectory called `__pycache__`\index{\_\_pycache\_\_ directory}

> We typically don't want to put the files in `__pycache__` in version control,
> so we normally tell Git to ignore it as discussed in Section \@ref(git-cmdline-ignore).

## Plotting {#scripting-plotting}

The last thing for us to do is to plot the word count distribution.
Recall that [Zipf's Law][zipfs-law] states the second most common word in a body of text
appears half as often as the most common,
the third most common appears a third as often, and so on.
Mathematically, this might be written as
"word frequency is proportional to 1/rank."

The following code plots the word frequency against the inverse rank
using the [pandas][pandas] library:

```python
import pandas as pd


input_csv = 'results/jane_eyre.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(input_csv, header=None,
                 names=('word', 'word_frequency'))
df['rank'] = df['word_frequency'].rank(ascending=False,
                                       method='max')
df['inverse_rank'] = 1 / df['rank']
scatplot = df.plot.scatter(x='word_frequency',
                           y='inverse_rank',
                           figsize=[12, 6],
                           grid=True)
fig = scatplot.get_figure()
fig.savefig('results/jane_eyre.png')
```

```{r scripting-repl, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Word frequency distribution for Jane Eyre."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/scripting/jane-eyre.png")
```

You'll build on this code to create a plotting script for your project
in Exercise \@ref(scripting-ex-better-plotting).

## Summary {#scripting-summary}

Why is building a simple command-line tool so complex?
One answer is that the conventions for command-line programs
have evolved over several decades,
so libraries like `argparse` must now support several different generations of option handling.
Another is that the things we want to do genuinely *are* complex:
read from either standard input or a list of files,
display help when asked to,
respect parameters that might not be there,
and so on.
As with many other things in programming (and life),
everyone wishes it was simpler,
but no one can agree on what to throw away.

The good news is that this complexity is a fixed cost:
our template for command-line tools can be re-used for programs
that are much larger than the examples shown in this chapter.
Making tools that behave in ways people expect
greatly increases the chances that others will find them useful.

## Exercises {#scripting-exercises}

### Running Python statements from the command line {#scripting-ex-command-line}

We don't need to open the interactive interpreter to run Python code.
Instead,
we can invoke Python with the command flag `-c`
and the statement we want to run:

```python
$ python -c "print(2+3)"
```

```text
5
```

When and why is this useful?

### Listing files {#scripting-ex-glob-ls}

A Python library called [glob][glob] can be used to create a list of files
matching a pattern, much like the `ls` shell command.

```bash
$ python
```
```text
Python 3.7.6 (default, Jan  8 2020, 13:42:34) 
[Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)] :: 
Anaconda, Inc. on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license"
for more information.
```
```python
>>> import glob
>>> glob.glob('data/*.txt')
```
```text
['data/moby_dick.txt', 'data/sense_and_sensibility.txt',
'data/sherlock_holmes.txt', 'data/time_machine.txt',
'data/frankenstein.txt', 'data/dracula.txt',
'data/jane_eyre.txt']
```

Using `script_template.py` as a guide,
write a new script called `my_ls.py`
that takes as input a directory and a suffix (e.g., py, txt, md, sh)
and outputs a list of the files (sorted alphabetically)
in that directory ending in that suffix.

The help information for the new script should read as follows:

```bash
$ python bin/my_ls.py -h
```

```text
usage: my_ls.py [-h] dir suffix

List the files in a given directory with a given suffix.

positional arguments:
  dir         Directory
  suffix      File suffix (e.g. py, sh)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

\newpage

and an example of the output would be:

```bash
$ python bin/my_ls.py data/ txt
```

```text
data/dracula.txt
data/frankenstein.txt
data/jane_eyre.txt
data/moby_dick.txt
data/sense_and_sensibility.txt
data/sherlock_holmes.txt
data/time_machine.txt
```

Note: we will not be including this script in subsequent chapters.

### Sentence ending punctuation {#scripting-ex-sentence-endings}

Our `countwords.py` script strips the punctuation from a text,
which means it provides no information on sentence endings.
Using `script_template.py` and `countwords.py` as a guide,
write a new script called `sentence_endings.py` that counts
the occurrence of full stops, question marks and exclamation points
and prints that information to the screen.

Hint: String objects have a `count` method:

```bash
$ python
```
```text
Python 3.7.6 (default, Jan  8 2020, 13:42:34) 
[Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)] :: 
Anaconda, Inc. on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license"
for more information.
```
```python
>>> "Hello! Are you ok?".count('!')
```
```text
1
```

When you're done,
the script should be able to accept an input file:

```bash
$ python bin/sentence_endings.py data/dracula.txt
```

```text
Number of . is 8505
Number of ? is 492
Number of ! is 752
```

or standard input:

```bash
$ head -n 500 data/dracula.txt | python bin/sentence_endings.py
```

```text
Number of . is 148
Number of ? is 8
Number of ! is 8
```

Note: we will not be including this script in subsequent chapters.

### A better plotting program {#scripting-ex-better-plotting}

Using `script_template.py` as a guide,
take the plotting code from Section \@ref(scripting-plotting)
and write a new Python program called `plotcounts.py`.
The script should do the following:

1. Use the `type=argparse.FileType('r')`, `nargs='?'` and `default='-'` options
   for the input file argument (i.e., similar to the `countwords.py` script)
   so that `plotcounts.py` uses standard input if no CSV file is given.

2. Include an optional `--outfile` argument for the name of the output image file.
   The default value should be `plotcounts.png`.

3. Include an optional `--xlim` argument so that the user can change the x-axis bounds.

When you are done,
generate a plot for *Jane Eyre* by passing the word counts to `plotcounts.py`
via a CSV file:

```bash
$ python bin/plotcounts.py results/jane_eyre.csv
  --outfile results/jane_eyre.png
```

and by standard input:

```bash
$ python bin/countwords.py data/jane_eyre.txt | python
  bin/plotcounts.py --outfile results/jane_eyre.png
```

Note:
the solution to this exercise is used in following chapters.
