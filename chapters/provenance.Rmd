We have now developed, automated, and tested
a workflow for plotting the word count distribution for classic novels.
In the normal course of events,
we would include the outputs from that workflow (e.g., our figures and \(\alpha\) values)
in a research paper or a report for a consulting client.

But modern publishing involves much more than producing a PDF
and making it available on a preprint server such as [arXiv][arxiv] or [bioRxiv][biorxiv].
It also entails providing the data underpinning the report
and the code used to do the analysis:\index{reproducible research}

While some reports, datasets, software packages, and analysis scripts
can't be published without violating personal or commercial confidentiality,
every researcher's default should be to make all these as widely available as possible.
Publishing it under an open license (Section \@ref(teams-license)) is the first step;
the sections below describe what else we can do to capture
the \gref{provenance}{provenance} of our data analysis.\index{provenance}

## Data Provenance {#provenance-data}

The first step in documenting the data associated with a report
is to determine what (if anything) needs to be published.\index{publishing!data}
If the report involved the analysis of a publicly available dataset
that is maintained and documented by a third party,
it's not necessary to publish a duplicate of the dataset:
the report simply needs to document where to access the data
and what version was analyzed.
This is the case for our Zipf's Law analysis,
since the texts we analyze are available at [Project Gutenberg][project-gutenberg].

It's not strictly necessary to publish intermediate data
produced during the analysis of a publicly available dataset either
(e.g., the CSV files produced by `countwords.py`),
so long as readers have access to the original data and the code/software used to process it.
However,
making intermediate data available can save people time and effort,
particularly if it takes a lot of computing power to reproduce it
(or if installing the required software is complicated).
For example,
NASA has published
the [Goddard Institute for Space Studies Surface Temperature Analysis][gistemp],
which estimates the global average surface temperature
based on thousands of land and ocean weather observations,
because a simple metric of global warming is expensive to produce
and is useful in many research contexts.

If a report involves a new dataset,
such as observations collected during a field experiment,
then that data needs to be published in its raw (unprocessed) form.
The publication of a dataset,
whether raw or intermediate,
should follow the FAIR Principles.

### The FAIR Principles {#provenance-data-fair}

The [FAIR Principles][go-fair] describe what research data should look like.\index{FAIR Principles}\index{publishing!FAIR Principles}
They are still aspirational for most researchers,
but tell us what to aim for [@Good2014; @Mich2015; @Hart2016; @Broc2019; @Tier2020].
The most immediately important elements of the FAIR Principles are outlined below.

#### Data should be *findable*

The first step in using or re-using data is to find it.
We can tell we've done this if:

1.  (Meta)data is assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier
    (i.e., a \gref{DOI}{doi}).
2.  Data is described with rich metadata.
3.  Metadata clearly and explicitly includes the identifier of the data it describes.
4.  (Meta)data is registered or indexed in a searchable resource,
    such as the data sharing platforms described in Section \@ref(provenance-data-where).

#### Data should be *accessible*

People can't use data if they don't have access to it.
In practice,
this rule means the data should be openly accessible (the preferred solution)
or that authenticating in order to view or download it should be free.
We can tell we've done this if:

1.  (Meta)data is retrievable by its identifier
    using a standard communications protocol like HTTP.
2.  Metadata is accessible even when the data is no longer available.

#### Data should be *interoperable*

Data usually needs to be integrated with other data,
which means that tools need to be able to process it.
We can tell we've done this if:

1.  (Meta)data uses a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.
2.  (Meta)data uses vocabularies that follow FAIR principles.
3.  (Meta)data includes qualified references to other (meta)data.

#### Data should be *reusable*

This is the ultimate purpose of the FAIR Principles and much other work.
We can tell we've done this if:

1.  (Meta)data is described with accurate and relevant attributes.
2.  (Meta)data is released with a clear and accessible data usage license.
3.  (Meta)data has detailed \gref{provenance}{provenance}.
4.  (Meta)data meets domain-relevant community standards.

### Where to archive data {#provenance-data-where}

Small datasets (i.e., anything under 500 MB) can be stored in version control.\index{publishing!data!archiving}
If the data is being used in several projects,
it may make sense to create one repository to hold only the data;
these are sometimes referred to as \gref{data packages}{data_package},\index{data package}\index{publishing!data!package}
and they are often accompanied by small scripts to clean up and query the data.

For medium-sized datasets (between 500 MB and 5 GB),
it's better to put the data on platforms
like the [Open Science Framework][osf], [Dryad][dryad], and [Figshare][figshare],
which will give the dataset a DOI.
Big datasets (i.e., anything more than 5 GB)
may not be ours in the first place,
and probably need the attention of a professional archivist.

> (e.g., the [Geoscience Data Journal][geoscience-data-journal])
> and there are also generic data journals
> (e.g., [Scientific Data][scientific-data]).

## Code Provenance {#provenance-code}

Our Zipf's Law analysis represents a typical data science project
in that we've written some code
that leverages other pre-existing software packages
in order to produce the key results of a report.\index{publishing!software}
To make a computational workflow like this open, transparent, and reproducible
we must archive three key items:

1.  A copy of any **analysis scripts or notebooks** used to produce the key results
    presented in the report.
2.  A detailed description of the **software environment**
    in which those analysis scripts or notebooks ran.
3.  A description of the **data processing steps** taken in producing each key result,
    i.e., a step-by-step account of which scripts were executed in what order
    for each key result.

Unfortunately,
librarians, publishers, and regulatory bodies are still trying to determine
the best way to document and archive material like this,
so a widely accepted set of FAIR Principles for research software
is still under development [@Lamp2020].
In the meantime, the best advice we can give is presented below.
It involves adding information about the software environment
and data processing steps to a GitHub repository that contains
the analysis scripts/notebooks,
before creating a new release of that repository and archiving it (with a DOI)
with [Zenodo][zenodo].

### Software environment {#provenance-code-environment}

In order to document the software packages used in our analysis,
we should archive a list of the names and version numbers of each software package.
We can get version information for the Python packages we are using by running:

```bash
$ pip freeze
```

```text
alabaster==0.7.12
anaconda-client==1.7.2
anaconda-navigator==1.9.12
anaconda-project==0.8.3
appnope==0.1.0
appscript==1.0.1
asn1crypto==1.0.1
...
```

Other command-line tools will often have an option like `--version` or `--status`
to access the version information.

Archiving a list of package names and version numbers would mean that our
software environment is technically reproducible,
but it would be left up to the reader of the report
to figure out how to get all those packages installed and working together.
This might be fine for a small number of packages with very few dependencies,
but in more complex cases we probably want to make life easier for the reader
(and for our future selves looking to re-run the analysis).
One way to make things easier is to export a description of
a complete conda environment
(Section \@ref(packaging-virtualenv); Appendix \@ref(anaconda-environments))\index{virtual environment},
which can be saved as YAML using:

```bash
$ conda env export > environment.yml
$ cat environment.yml
```
```text
name: base
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - _ipyw_jlab_nb_ext_conf=0.1.0=py37_0
  - alabaster=0.7.12=py37_0
  - anaconda=2019.10=py37_0
  - anaconda-client=1.7.2=py37_0
  - anaconda-navigator=1.9.12=py37_0
  - anaconda-project=0.8.3=py_0
  - appnope=0.1.0=py37_0
  - appscript=1.1.0=py37h1de35cc_0
  - asn1crypto=1.0.1=py37_0
...
```

That software environment can be re-created on another computer with one line of code:

```
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Since this `environment.yml` file is an important part of reproducing the analysis,
remember to add it to your GitHub repository.

> However,

### Data processing steps {#provenance-code-steps}

The second item that needs to be added to our GitHub repository is a description
of the data processing steps involved in each key result.\index{publishing!description of workflow}
Assuming the author list on our report is Amira Khan and Sami Virtanen (Section \@ref(intro-personas)),
we could add a new Markdown file called `KhanVirtanen2020.md` to the repository
to describe the steps:

```markdown
The code in this repository was used in generating the results
for the following paper:

Khan A & Virtanen S, 2020. Zipf's Law in classic english texts.
*Journal of Important Research*, 27, 134-139.

The code was executed in the software environment described by
`environment.yml`. It can be installed using
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):
$ conda env create -f environment.yml

Figure 1 in the paper was created by running the following at
the command line:
$ make all
```

We should also add this information as an appendix to the report itself.

### Analysis scripts {#provenance-code-scripts}

Later in this book we will package and release our Zipf's Law code
so that it can be downloaded and installed by the wider research community,
just like any other Python package (Chapter \@ref(packaging)).
Doing this is especially helpful if other people might be interested in using and/or extending it,
but often the scripts and notebooks we write to produce a particular figure or table
are too case-specific to be of broad interest.
To fully capture the provenance of the results presented in a report,
these analysis scripts and/or notebooks
(along with the details of the associated software environment and data processing steps)
can simply be archived with a repository like [Figshare][figshare] or [Zenodo][zenodo],
which specialize in storing the long tail of research projects
(i.e., supplementary figures, data, and code).
Uploading a zip file of analysis scripts to the repository is a valid option,
but more recently the process has been streamlined via direct integration
between GitHub and Zenodo.
As described in [this tutorial][github-zenodo-tutorial],
the process involves creating a new release of our repository in GitHub
that Zenodo copies and then issues a DOI for (Figure \@ref(fig:provenance-release)).

```{r provenance-release, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="A new code release on GitHub."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/provenance/release.png")
```

### Reproducibility versus inspectability {#provenance-inspectability}

In most cases,
documenting our software environment, analysis scripts, and data processing steps
will ensure that our computational analysis is reproducible/repeatable
at the time our report is published.\index{reproducible research}
But what about five or ten years later?
As we have discussed,
data analysis workflows usually depend on a hierarchy of packages.
Our Zipf's Law analysis depends on a collection of Python libraries,
which in turn depend on the Python language itself.
Some workflows also depend critically on a particular operating system.
Over time some of these dependencies will inevitably be updated or no longer supported,
meaning our workflow will be documented but not reproducible.

Fortunately,
most readers are not looking to exactly re-run a decade-old analysis:
they just want to be able to figure out what was run
and what the important decisions were,
which is sometimes referred to as \gref{inspectability}{inspectability}\index{inspectability}
[@Gil2016; @Brow2017].
While exact repeatability has a short shelf-life,
inspectability is the enduring legacy of a well-documented computational analysis.

## Summary {#provenance-summary}

The Internet started a revolution in scientific publishing
that shows no sign of ending.
Where an inter-library loan once took weeks to arrive
and data had to be transcribed from published papers
(if it could be found at all),
we can now download one another's work in minutes:
*if* we can find it and make sense of it.
Organizations like [Our Research][our-research] are building tools to help with both;
by using DOIs and ORCIDs,
publishing on preprint servers,
following the FAIR Principles,
and documenting our workflow,
we help ensure that everyone can pursue their ideas as we did.

## Exercises {#provenance-exercises}

### ORCID {#provenance-ex-get-orcid}

If you don't already have an \gref{ORCID}{orcid},
go to the website and register now.
If you do have an ORCID,
log in and make sure that your details and publication record are up-to-date.

### A FAIR test {#provenance-ex-fair-test}

An [online questionnaire][fair-questionnaire]
for measuring the extent to which datasets are FAIR
has been created by the Australian Research Data Commons.
Fill in the questionnaire for a dataset you have published or that you use often.

### Evaluate a project's data provenance {#provenance-ex-understand-project}

*This exercise is modified from @Wick2016 and explores the dataset from @Meil2016.
Go to the dataset's page <http://doi.org/10.3886/E17507V2> and download the files.
You will need to make an ICPSER account and agree to their data agreement before you can download.*

Review the dataset's main page to get a sense of the study,
then review the spreadsheet file and the coded response file.

1.  Who are the participants of this study?
2.  What types of data were collected and used for analysis?
3.  Can you find information on the demographics of the interviewees?
4.  This dataset is clearly in support of an article.
    What information can you find about it, and can you find a link to it?

### Evaluate a project's code provenance {#provenance-ex-eval-code}

The GitHub repository [`borstlab/reversephi_paper`][borstlab-reversephi] provides the code and data for the paper @Leon2017.
Browse the repository and answer the following questions:

1.  Where is the software environment described? What files would you need to re-create the software environment?
2.  Where are the data processing steps described? How could you re-create the results included in the manuscript?
3.  How are the scripts and data archived?
    That is, where can you download the version of the code and data as it was when the manuscript was published?

To get a feel for the different approaches to code provenance, repeat steps 1-3 with the following:

* [The figshare page][irving-figshare] that accompanies the paper @Irvi2019.

* The GitHub repo [`blab/h3n2-reassortment`][blab-h3n2-reassortment] that accompanies the paper @Pott2019.

### Making permanent links {#provenance-ex-permanent-links}

The link to the UK Home Office's [accessibility guideline posters][ukho-accessibility] might change in future.
Use the [Wayback Machine][wayback-machine] to find a link that is more likely to be usable in the long run.

### Create an archive of your Zipf's analysis {#provenance-ex-release}

A slightly less permanent alternative to having a DOI for your analysis code
is to provide a link to a GitHub release.
Follow [the instructions on GitHub][github-release] to create a release for the current state of your `zipf/` project.

Once you've created the release,
[read about how to link to it][github-release-link].
What is the URL that allows direct download of the zip archive
of your release?

> **What about getting a DOI?**
>
> Creating a GitHub release is also a necessary step

> (Section \@ref(provenance-code-scripts)).
> We are stopping short of getting the DOI here,
> since nobody reading this book needs to formally cite
> or archive the example Zipf's Law software we've been developing. 
> Also, if every reader of the book generated a DOI,
> we'd have many DOIs pointing to the same code!

### Publishing your code {#provenance-ex-publish-code}

Think about a project that you're currently working on.
How would you go about publishing the code associated with that project
(i.e., the software description, analysis scripts, and data processing steps)?
