We have written software to count and analyze the words in classic texts,
but how can we be sure it's producing reliable results?
The short is answer is that we can't---not completely---but
we can test its behavior against our expectations to decide if we are sure enough.
This chapter explores ways to do this,
including assertions, unit tests, integration tests, and regression tests.

## Assertions {#testing-assertions}

The first step in building confidence in our programs
is to assume that mistakes will happen and guard against them.
This is called \gref{defensive programming}{defensive_programming},\index{defensive programming}
and the most common way to do it is to add \gref{assertions}{assertion} to our code\index{assertion}\index{Python!assertion}
so that it checks itself as it runs.
An assertion is a statement that something must be true at a certain point in a program.
When Python sees an assertion, it checks the assertion's condition.
If it's true, Python does nothing;
if it's false,
Python halts the program immediately and prints a user-defined error message.
For example,
this code halts as soon as the loop encounters an impossible word frequency:

```python
frequencies = [13, 10, 2, -4, 5, 6, 25]
total = 0.0
for freq in frequencies[:5]:
    assert freq >= 0.0, 'Word frequencies must be non-negative'
    total += freq
print('total frequency of first 5 words:', total)
```

```text
---------------------------------------------------------------
AssertionError                Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-19-33d87ea29ae4> in <module>()
      2 total = 0.0
      3 for freq in frequencies[:5]:
----> 4     assert freq >= 0.0, 'Word frequencies must be
            non-negative'
      5     total += freq
      6 print('total frequency of first 5 words:', total)

AssertionError: Word frequencies must be non-negative
```

Programs intended for widespread use are full of assertions:
10%--20% of the code they contain are there to check that the other 80%--90% are working correctly.
Broadly speaking, assertions fall into three categories:

-   A \gref{precondition}{precondition}\index{precondition (in program)}\index{assertion!precondition}
    is something that must be true at the start of a function
    in order for it to work correctly.
    For example,
    a function might check that the list it has been given has at least two elements
    and that all of its elements are integers.

-   A \gref{postcondition}{postcondition}\index{postcondition (in program)}\index{assertion!postcondition}
    is something that the function guarantees is true
    when it finishes.
    For example,
    a function could check that the value being returned is an integer
    that is greater than zero,
    but less than the length of the input list.

-   An \gref{invariant}{invariant}\index{invariant (in program)}\index{assertion!invariant}
    is something that is true for every iteration in a loop.
    The invariant might be a property of the data (as in the example above),
    or it might be something like,
    "the value of `highest` is less than or equal to the current loop index."

The function `get_power_law_params` in our `plotcounts.py` script
is a good example of the need for a precondition.
Its docstring does not say that its `word_counts` parameter must be a list of numeric word counts;
even if we add that,
a user might easily pass in a list of the words themselves instead.
Adding an assertion makes the requirement clearer,
and also guarantees that the function will fail as soon as it is called
rather than returning an error from `scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar`
that would be more difficult to interpret/debug.

```python
def get_power_law_params(word_counts):
    """
    Get the power law parameters.

Update `plotcounts.py` with the assertion described above.
You'll see additional examples of assertions throughout this chapter.

## Unit Testing {#testing-unit}

Catching errors is good, but preventing them is better,
so responsible programmers test their code.
As the name suggests,
a \gref{unit test}{unit_test}\index{unit test}\index{testing!unit test}
checks the correctness of a single unit of software.
Exactly what constitutes a "unit" is subjective,
but it typically means the behavior of a single function in one situation.
In our Zipf's Law software,
the `count_words` function in `countwords.py` is
a good candidate for unit testing:

```python
def count_words(reader):
    """Count the occurrence of each word in a string."""
    text = reader.read()
    chunks = text.split()
    npunc = [word.strip(string.punctuation) for word in chunks]
    word_list = [word.lower() for word in npunc if word]
    word_counts = Counter(word_list)
    return word_counts
```

\newpage

A single unit test will typically have:

-   a \gref{fixture}{fixture},\index{testing!fixture}\index{fixture (of test)}
    which is the thing being tested (e.g., an array of numbers);
-   an \gref{actual result}{actual_result},\index{testing!actual result}\index{actual result (of test)}
    which is what the code produces when given the fixture;
    and
-   an \gref{expected result}{expected_result}\index{testing!expected result}\index{expected result (of test)}
    that the actual result is compared to.

The fixture is typically a subset or smaller version of the data
the function will typically process.
For instance,
in order to write a unit test for the `count_words` function,
we could use a piece of text small enough for us to count word frequencies by hand.
Let's add the poem *Risk* by Anaïs Nin to our data:

```bash
$ cd ~/zipf
$ mkdir test_data
$ cat test_data/risk.txt
```

```text
And then the day came,
when the risk
to remain tight
in a bud
was more painful
than the risk
it took
to blossom.
```

We can then count the words by hand to construct the expected result:

```python
from collections import Counter


risk_poem_counts = {'the': 3, 'risk': 2, 'to': 2, 'and': 1,
  'then': 1, 'day': 1, 'came': 1, 'when': 1, 'remain': 1,
  'tight': 1, 'in': 1, 'a': 1, 'bud': 1, 'was': 1,
  'more': 1, 'painful': 1, 'than': 1, 'it': 1, 'took': 1,
  'blossom': 1}
expected_result = Counter(risk_poem_counts)
```

We then generate the actual result by calling `count_words`,
and use an assertion to check if it is what we expected:

```python
import sys
sys.path.append('/Users/amira/zipf/bin')
import countwords


with open('test_data/risk.txt', 'r') as reader:
    actual_result = countwords.count_words(reader)
assert actual_result == expected_result
```

There's no output,
which means the assertion (and test) passed.
(Remember, assertions only do something if the condition is false.)

## Testing Frameworks {#testing-framework}

Writing one unit test is easy enough,
but we should check other cases as well.
To manage them,
we can use a \gref{test framework}{test_framework}\index{test framework}\index{testing!framework}
(also called a \gref{test runner}{test_runner}).
The most widely used test framework for Python is called [`pytest`][pytest],
which structures tests as follows:

1.  Tests are put in files whose names begin with `test_`.
2.  Each test is a function whose name also begins with `test_`.
3.  These functions use `assert` to check results.

Following these rules,
we can create a `test_zipfs.py` script in your `bin` directory
that contains the test we just developed:

```python
from collections import Counter

import countwords


def test_word_count():
    """Test the counting of words.

    The example poem is Risk, by Anaïs Nin.
    """
    risk_poem_counts = {'the': 3, 'risk': 2, 'to': 2, 'and': 1,
      'then': 1, 'day': 1, 'came': 1, 'when': 1, 'remain': 1,
      'tight': 1, 'in': 1, 'a': 1, 'bud': 1, 'was': 1,
      'more': 1, 'painful': 1, 'than': 1, 'it': 1, 'took': 1,
      'blossom': 1}
    expected_result = Counter(risk_poem_counts)
    with open('test_data/risk.txt', 'r') as reader:
        actual_result = countwords.count_words(reader)
    assert actual_result == expected_result
```

The `pytest` library comes with a command-line tool that is also called `pytest`.
When we run it with no options,
it searches for all files in or below the working directory
whose names match the pattern `test_*.py`.
It then runs the tests in these files and summarizes their results.
(If we only want to run the tests in a particular file,
we can use the command `pytest path/to/test_file.py`.)

```bash
$ pytest
```
```text
==================== test session starts ======================

===================== 1 passed in 0.02s =======================
```

To add more tests,
we simply write more `test_` functions in `test_zipfs.py`.
For instance,
besides counting words,
the other critical part of our code is the calculation of the \(\alpha\) parameter.
Earlier we defined a power law relating \(\alpha\)
to the word frequency \(f\),
the word rank \(r\),
and a constant of proportionality \(c\) (Section \@ref(git-advanced-theory)):

\[
r = cf^{\frac{-1}{\alpha}}
\]

We also noted that Zipf's Law holds exactly when \(\alpha\) is equal to one.
Setting \(\alpha\) to one and re-arranging the power law gives us:

\[
c = f/r
\]

We can use this formula to generate synthetic word count data
(i.e., our test fixture)
with a constant of proportionality set to a hypothetical maximum word frequency of 600
(and thus \(r\) ranges from 1 to 600):

```python
import numpy as np


max_freq = 600
counts = np.floor(max_freq / np.arange(1, max_freq + 1))
print(counts)
```

```text
[600. 300. 200. 150. 120. 100.  85.  75.  66.  60.  54.  50.
  46.  42.  40.  37.  35.  33.  31.  30.  28.  27.  26.  25.
 ...
   1.   1.   1.   1.   1.   1.   1.   1.   1.   1.   1.   1.]
```

(We use `np.floor` to round down to the nearest whole number,
because we can't have fractional word counts.)
Passing this test fixture to `get_power_law_params` in `plotcounts.py`
should give us a value of 1.0.
To test this, we can add a second test to `test_zipfs.py`:

```python
from collections import Counter

import numpy as np

import plotcounts
import countwords


def test_alpha():
    """Test the calculation of the alpha parameter.

    The test word counts satisfy the relationship,
      r = cf**(-1/alpha), where
      r is the rank,
      f the word count, and
      c is a constant of proportionality.

    To generate test word counts for an expected alpha of
      1.0, a maximum word frequency of 600 is used
      (i.e. c = 600 and r ranges from 1 to 600)
    """
    max_freq = 600
    counts = np.floor(max_freq / np.arange(1, max_freq + 1))
    actual_alpha = plotcounts.get_power_law_params(counts)
    expected_alpha = 1.0
    assert actual_alpha == expected_alpha


def test_word_count():
    #...as before...
```

Let's re-run both of our tests:

```bash
$ pytest
```

```text

      expected_alpha = 1.0

================= 1 failed, 1 passed in 3.98s =================

```

The output tells us that one test failed but the other test passed.
This is a very useful feature of test runners like `pytest`:
they continue on and complete all the tests
rather than stopping at the first assertion failure as a regular Python script would.

## Testing Floating-Point Values {#testing-numeric}

The output above shows that while `test_alpha` failed,
the `actual_alpha` value of 0.9951524579316625 was very close to the expected value of 1.0.
After a bit of thought,
we decide that this isn't actually a failure:
the value produced by `get_power_law_params` is an estimate,
and being off by half a percent is good enough.\index{testing!floating-point calculations}

This example shows that testing scientific software
almost always requires us to make the same kind of judgment calls
that scientists have to make when doing any other sort of experimental work.
If we are measuring the mass of a proton,
we might expect ten decimal places of accuracy.
If we are measuring the weight of a baby penguin,
on the other hand,
we'll probably be satisfied if we're within five grams.
What matters most is that we are explicit about the bounds we used
so that other people can tell what we actually did.

> **Degrees of Difficulty**
>
> There's an old joke that physicists worry about decimal places,
> astronomers worry about powers of ten,
> and economists are happy if they've got the sign right.

So how should we write tests when we don't know precisely what the right answer is?
The best approach is to write tests that check
if the actual value is within some \gref{tolerance}{tolerance} of the expected value.\index{testing!tolerance}\index{tolerance (of test)}
The tolerance can be expressed as the \gref{absolute error}{absolute_error},\index{absolute error}\index{error!absolute}
which is the absolute value of the difference between two,
or the \gref{relative error}{relative_error},\index{relative error}\index{error!relative}
which the ratio of the absolute error to the value we're approximating [@Gold1991].
For example,
if we add 9+1 and get 11,
the absolute error is 1 (i.e., \(11-10\)),
and the relative error is 10%.
If we add \(99+1\) and get 101,
on the other hand,
the absolute error is still 1,
but the relative error is only 1%.

For `test_alpha`,
we might decide that an absolute error of 0.01 in the estimation of \(\alpha\) is acceptable.
If we are using `pytest`,
we can check that values lie within this tolerance using `pytest.approx`:

```python
from collections import Counter

import pytest
import numpy as np

import plotcounts
import countwords


def test_alpha():
    """Test the calculation of the alpha parameter.

    The test word counts satisfy the relationship,
      r = cf**(-1/alpha), where
      r is the rank,
      f the word count, and
      c is a constant of proportionality.

    To generate test word counts for an expected alpha of
      1.0, a maximum word frequency of 600 is used
      (i.e. c = 600 and r ranges from 1 to 600)
    """
    max_freq = 600
    counts = np.floor(max_freq / np.arange(1, max_freq + 1))
    actual_alpha = plotcounts.get_power_law_params(counts)
    expected_alpha = pytest.approx(1.0, abs=0.01)
    assert actual_alpha == expected_alpha


def test_word_count():
    #...as before...
```

When we re-run `pytest`,
both tests now pass:

```bash
$ pytest
```

## Integration Testing {#testing-integration}

Our Zipf's Law analysis has two steps:
counting the words in a text
and estimating the \(\alpha\) parameter from the word count.
Our unit tests give us some confidence that these components work in isolation,
but do they work correctly together?
Checking that is called \gref{integration testing}{integration_test}.\index{testing!integration test}\index{integration test}

Integration tests are structured the same way as unit tests:
a fixture is used to produce an actual result
that is compared against the expected result.
However,
creating the fixture and running the code
can be considerably more complicated.
For example,
in the case of our Zipf's Law software, an appropriate integration test fixture
might be a text file with a word frequency distribution that has a known \(\alpha\) value.
In order to create this text fixture,
we need a way to generate random words.

Fortunately, a Python library called 
[`RandomWordGenerator`](https://github.com/AbhishekSalian/Random-Word-Generator) 
exists to do just that.
We can install it using [`pip`][pip], the Python Package Installer:

```bash
$ pip install Random-Word-Generator
```

Borrowing from the word count distribution we created for `test_alpha`,
we can use the following code to create a text file full of random words
with a frequency distribution that corresponds to an \(\alpha\) of approximately 1.0:

```python
import numpy as np
from RandomWordGenerator import RandomWord


max_freq = 600
word_counts = np.floor(max_freq / np.arange(1, max_freq + 1))
rw = RandomWord()
random_words = rw.getList(num_of_words=max_freq)
writer = open('test_data/random_words.txt', 'w')
for index in range(max_freq):
    count = int(word_counts[index])
    word_sequence = f'{random_words[index]} ' * count
    writer.write(word_sequence + '\n')
writer.close()
```

We can confirm this code worked by checking the resulting file:

```bash
tail -n 5 test_data/random_words.txt
```

```text
lZnkzoBHRb 
djiroplqrJ 
HmAUGOncHg 
DGLpfTIitu 
KALSfPkrga
```

We can then add this integration test to `test_zipfs.py`:

```python
def test_integration():
    """Test the full word count to alpha parameter workflow."""
    with open('test_data/random_words.txt', 'r') as reader:
        word_counts_dict = countwords.count_words(reader)
    counts_array = np.array(list(word_counts_dict.values()))
    actual_alpha = plotcounts.get_power_law_params(counts_array)
    expected_alpha = pytest.approx(1.0, abs=0.01)
    assert actual_alpha == expected_alpha
```

Finally,
we re-run `pytest` to check that the integration test passes:

```bash
$ pytest
```

```text

```

## Regression Testing {#testing-regression}

So far we have tested two simplified texts:
a short poem and a collection of random words with a known frequency distribution.
The next step is to test with real data,
i.e., an actual book.
The problem is,
we don't know the expected result:
it's not practical to count the words in *Dracula* by hand,
and even if we tried,
the odds are good that we'd make a mistake.

For this kind of situation we can use
\gref{regression testing}{regression_testing}.\index{testing!regression test}\index{regression test}
Rather than assuming that the test's author knows what the expected result should be,
regression tests compare today's answer with a previous one.
This doesn't guarantee that the answer is right---if the original answer is wrong,
we could carry that mistake forward indefinitely---but
it does draw attention to any changes (or "regressions").

In Section \@ref(git-advanced-zipf-verify)
we calculated an \(\alpha\) of 1.0866646252515038 for *Dracula*.
Let's use that value to add a regression test to `test_zipfs.py`:

```python
def test_regression():
    """Regression test for Dracula."""
    with open('data/dracula.txt', 'r') as reader:
        word_counts_dict = countwords.count_words(reader)
    counts_array = np.array(list(word_counts_dict.values()))
    actual_alpha = plotcounts.get_power_law_params(counts_array)
    expected_alpha = pytest.approx(1.087, abs=0.001)
    assert actual_alpha == expected_alpha
```

```bash
$ pytest
```

```text

```

## Test Coverage {#testing-coverage}

How much of our code do the tests we have written check?
More importantly,
what parts of our code \emph{aren't} being tested (yet)?
To find out,
we can use a tool to check their \gref{code coverage}{code_coverage}.\index{code coverage (of testing)}\index{testing!code coverage}
Most Python programmers use the `coverage` library,
which we can once again install using `pip`:

```bash
$ pip install coverage
```

Once we have it,
we can use it to run `pytest` on our behalf:

```bash
$ coverage run -m pytest
```

```text

====================== 4 passed in 0.72s ======================
```

The `coverage` command doesn't display any information of its own,
since mixing that in with our program's output would be confusing.
Instead,
it puts coverage data in a file called `.coverage` (with a leading `.`) in the current directory.
To display that data,
we run:

```bash
$ coverage report -m
```

```text
bin/countwords.py      20      7    65%   25-26, 30-38
bin/plotcounts.py      58     37    36%   48-55, 75-77, 82-83, 
                                          88-118, 122-140
bin/test_zipfs.py      31      0   100%
bin/utilities.py        8      5    38%   18-22
-------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                 117     49    58%
```

This summary shows us that
some lines of `countwords.py` or `plotcounts.py`
were not executed when we ran the tests:
in fact,
only 65% and 36% of the lines were run respectively.
This makes sense,
since much of the code in those scripts
is devoted to handling command-line arguments or file I/O
rather than the word counting and parameter estimation functionality
that our unit, integration, and regression tests focus on.

To make sure that's the case,
we can get a more complete report by running `coverage html` at the command line
and opening `htmlcov/index.html`.
Clicking on the name of our `countwords.py` script, for instance,
produces the colorized line-by-line display shown in Figure \@ref(fig:python-coverage).

```{r python-coverage, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Example of Python code coverage report."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/testing/python-coverage.png")
```

This output confirms that all lines relating to word counting were tested,
but not any of the lines related to argument handling or I/O.

Is this good enough?
The answer depends on what the software is being used for and by whom.
If it is for a safety-critical application such as a medical device,
we should aim for 100% code coverage,
i.e.,
every single line in the application should be tested.
In fact,
we should probably go further and aim for 100% \gref{path coverage}{path_coverage}
to ensure that every possible path through the code has been checked.
Similarly,
if the software has become popular and is being used by thousands of researchers all over the world,
we should probably check that it's not going to embarrass us.

But most of us don't write software that people's lives depend on,
or that is in a "top 100" list,
so requiring 100% code coverage is like asking for ten decimal places of accuracy
when checking the voltage of a household electrical outlet.
We always need to balance the effort required to create tests
against the likelihood that those tests will uncover useful information.
We also have to accept that no amount of testing
can prove a piece of software is completely correct.
A function with only two numeric arguments has 2^128^ possible inputs.
Even if we could write the tests,
how could we be sure we were checking the result of each one correctly?

\newpage

Luckily,
we can usually put test cases into groups.
For example,
when testing a function that summarizes a table full of data,
it's probably enough to check that it handles tables with:

-   no rows
-   only one row
-   many identical rows
-   rows having keys that are supposed to be unique, but aren't
-   rows that contain nothing but missing values

Some projects develop \gref{checklists}{checklist} like this one\index{testing!checklist}
to remind programmers what they ought to test.
These checklists can be a bit daunting for newcomers,
but they are a great way to pass on hard-earned experience.

## Continuous Integration {#testing-ci}

Now that we have a set of tests,
we could run `pytest` every now and again to check our code.
This is probably sufficient for short-lived projects,
but if several people are involved,
or if we are making changes over weeks or months,
we might forget to run the tests
or it might be difficult to identify which change is responsible for a test failure.

The solution is \gref{continuous integration}{continuous_integration} (CI),\index{continuous integration}\index{CI (continuous integration)}
which runs tests automatically whenever a change is made.\index{testing!continuous integration}
CI tells developers immediately if changes have caused problems,
which makes them much easier to fix.
CI can also be set up to run tests with several different configurations of the software
or on several different operating systems,
so that a programmer using Windows
can be warned that a change breaks things for Mac users and vice versa.

One popular CI tool is [Travis CI][travis-ci],
which integrates well with
[GitHub][github].\index{continuous integration!use with version control}\index{version control!and continuous integration}
If Travis CI has been set up,
then every time a change is committed to a GitHub repository,
Travis CI creates a fresh environment,
makes a fresh clone of the repository (Section \@ref(git-advanced-fork)),
and runs whatever commands the project's managers have set up.

Before setting up our account with Travis CI, however,
we need to prepare our repository to be recognized by the tool.
We'll first add a file called `.travis.yml` to our repository,
which includes instructions for Travis CI.
(The leading `.` in the name hides the file from casual listings on Mac or Linux,
but not on Windows.)
This file must be in the root directory of the repository,
and is written in \gref{YAML}{yaml_glossary}
(Section \@ref(config-formats) and Appendix \@ref(yaml)).
For our project,
we add the following lines:

```yaml
language: python

python:
- "3.6"

install:
- pip install -r requirements.txt

script:
- pytest
```

> **Python 3.6?**
> 
> An early draft of the book used Python 3.6, 
> and we later updated to 3.7.
> Over the life of a real project,
> software versions change,
> and it's not always feasible or possible to re-do all parts of the project.
> In this case,
> our first build in Travis CI used Python 3.6,
> so that's what we've shown here,
> and later checked that updating to 3.7 didn't break anything.
> We can't expect our software will be perfect the first time around,
> but we can do our best to document what's changed and confirm
> our results are still accurate.

The `language` key tells Travis CI which programming language to use,
so that it knows which of its standard \gref{virtual machines}{virtual_machine} to use\index{continuous integration!use of virtual machines}
as a starting point for the project.
The `python` key specifies the version or versions of Python to use,
while the `install` key indicates the name of the file (`requirements.txt`)
listing the libraries that need to be installed.
The `script` key lists the commands to run---in this case, `pytest`---which
in turn executes our project scripts
(i.e., `test_zipfs.py`, `plotcounts.py`, `countwords.py` and `utilities.py`).
These scripts import a number of packages that don't come with the
[Python Standard Library][python-standard-library],
so these are what comprise `requirements.txt`:

```text
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scipy
pytest
pyyaml
```

Be sure to save both `requirements.txt` and `.travis.yml`
to your project's root directory,
commit to your repository,
and push to GitHub,
or Travis CI will not be able to recognize your project.

We're now ready to set up CI for our project.
The basic steps are as follows:

1.  Create an account on [Travis CI][travis-ci] (if we don't already have one).
2.  Link our Travis CI account to our GitHub account (if we haven't done so already).
3.  Tell Travis CI to watch the repository that contains our project.

Creating an account with an online service is probably a familiar process,
but linking our Travis CI account to our GitHub account may be something new.
We only have to do this once
to allow Travis CI to access all our GitHub repositories,
but we should always be careful when giving sites access to other sites,
and only trust well-established and widely used services.

We can tell Travis CI which repository we want it to watch
by clicking the "+" next to the "My Repositories" link
on the left-hand side of the Travis CI homepage (Figure \@ref(fig:testing-add-repo)).

```{r testing-add-repo, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Click to add a new GitHub repository to Travis CI.", out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/testing/travis-add-repo.png")
```

To add the GitHub repository we have been using throughout this book,
find it in the repository list
(Figure \@ref(fig:testing-list-repos)).
If the repository doesn't show up,
re-synchronize the list using the green "Sync account" button on the left sidebar.
If it still doesn't appear,
the repository may belong to someone else or be private,
or your required files may be incorrect.
Click the "Trigger a build" button to initiate your first test using Travis CI.

```{r testing-list-repos, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Find Zipf's Law repository and trigger a build."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/testing/travis-list-repos.png")
```

Once your repository has been activated,
Travis CI follows the instructions in `.travis.yml`
and reports whether the build passed (shown in green)
or produced warnings or errors (shown in red).
To create this report, Travis CI has done the following:

1.  Created a new Linux virtual machine.
2.  Installed the desired version of Python.
3.  Run the commands below the `script` key.
4.  Reported the results at `https://travis-ci.com/USER/REPO`,
    where `USER/REPO`
    identifies the repository for a given user.

Our tests pass and the build completes successfully.
We can view additional details about the test by clicking on the
repository name
(Figure \@ref(fig:testing-build-pass)).

```{r testing-build-pass, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Travis build overview (build succeeded)."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/testing/travis-build-pass.png")
```

This example shows one of the other benefits of CI:
it forces us to be explicit about what we are doing and how we do it,
just as writing a Makefile forces us to be explicit about exactly how we produce results [@Zamp2020].

## When to Write Tests {#testing-tdd}

We have now met the three major types of test: unit, integration, and regression.
At what point in the code development process should we write these?
The answer depends on who you ask.

Many programmers are passionate advocates of a practice called
\gref{test-driven development}{tdd}
(TDD).\index{test-driven development}\index{testing!test-driven development}\index{TDD (test-driven development)}
Rather than writing code and then writing tests,
they write the tests first and then write just enough code to make those tests pass.
Once the code is working,
they clean it up (Appendix \@ref(style-refactor)) and then move on to the next task.
TDD's advocates claim that this leads to better code because:

1.  Writing tests clarifies what the code is actually supposed to do.

2.  It eliminates \gref{confirmation bias}{confirmation_bias}.
    If someone has just written a function,
    they are predisposed to want it to be right,
    so they will bias their tests towards proving that it is correct
    instead of trying to uncover errors.

3.  Writing tests first ensures that they actually get written.

These arguments are plausible.
However,
studies such as @Fucc2016 and @Fucc2017 don't support them:
in practice,
writing tests first or last doesn't appear to affect productivity.
What *does* have an impact is working in small, interleaved increments,
i.e.,
writing just a few lines of code and testing it before moving on
rather than writing several pages of code and then spending hours on testing.

So how do most data scientists figure out if their software is doing the right thing?
The answer is spot checks:
each time they produce an intermediate or final result,
they scan a table, create a chart, or inspect some summary statistics
to see if everything looks OK.
Their heuristics are usually easy to state,
like "there shouldn't be NAs at this point" or "the age range should be reasonable,"
but applying those heuristics to a particular analysis always depends on
their evolving insight into the data in question.

By analogy with test-driven development,
we could call this process "checking-driven development."
Each time we add a step to our pipeline and look at its output,
we can also add a check of some kind to the pipeline to ensure that
what we are checking for remains true as the pipeline evolves or is run on other data.
Doing this helps reusability---it's amazing how often a one-off analysis
winds up being used many times---but the real goal is comprehensibility.
If someone can get our code and data,
then runs the code on the data,
and gets the same result that we did,
then our computation is reproducible,
but that doesn't mean they can understand it.
Comments help
(either in the code or as blocks of prose in a \gref{computational notebook}{computational_notebook}),
but they won't check that assumptions and invariants hold.
And unlike comments,
runnable assertions can't fall out of step with what the code is actually doing.

## Summary {#testing-summary}

Testing data analysis pipelines is often harder than testing mainstream software applications,
since data analysts often don't know what the right answer is [@Brai2018].
(If we did,
we would have submitted our report and moved on to the next problem already.)
The key distinction is the difference between \gref{validation}{validation},
which asks whether the specification is correct,
and \gref{verification}{verification},
which asks whether we have met that specification.
The difference between them is the difference between
building the right thing and building something right;
the practices introduced in this chapter will help with both.

## Exercises {#testing-exercises}

### Explaining assertions {#testing-ex-explain-assertions}

Given a list of numbers,
the function `total` returns the total:

```python
total([1, 2, 3, 4])
```

```text
10
```

The function only works on numbers:

```python
total(['a', 'b', 'c'])
```

```text
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'a'
```

Explain in words what the assertions in this function check,
and for each one,
give an example of input that will make that assertion fail.

```python
def total(values):
    assert len(values) > 0
    for element in values:
        assert int(element)
    values = [int(element) for element in values]
    total = sum(values)
    assert total > 0
    return total
```

### Rectangle normalization {#testing-ex-rectangles}

A rectangle can be described using a tuple of four cartesian coordinates `(x0, y0, x1, y1)`,
where `(x0, y0)` represents the lower left corner and `(x1, y1)` the upper right.
In order to do some calculations,
suppose we need to be able to normalize rectangles so that the lower left corner
is at the origin (i.e., `(x0, y0) = (0, 0)`) and the longest side is 1.0 units long.
This function does that:

```python
def normalize_rectangle(rect):
    """Normalizes a rectangle so that it is at the origin
    and 1.0 units long on its longest axis.  Input should be
    (x0, y0, x1, y1), where (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) define the
    lower left and upper right corners of the rectangle."""

    # insert preconditions
    x0, y0, x1, y1 = rect
    # insert preconditions

    dx = x1 - x0
    dy = y1 - y0
    if dx > dy:
        scaled = float(dx) / dy
        upper_x, upper_y = 1.0, scaled
    else:
        scaled = float(dx) / dy
        upper_x, upper_y = scaled, 1.0

    # insert postconditions here

    return (0, 0, upper_x, upper_y)
```

In order to answer the following questions,
cut and paste the `normalize_rectangle` function into a new file called `geometry.py` 
(outside of your `zipf` project) and
save that file in a new directory called `exercises`.

1. To ensure that the inputs to `normalize_rectangle` are valid,
add \gref{preconditions}{precondition} to check that:
(a) `rect` contains 4 coordinates,
(b) the width of the rectangle is a positive, non-zero value (i.e., `x0 < x1`), and
(c) the height of the rectangle is a positive, non-zero value (i.e., `y0 < y1`).

2. If the normalization calculation has worked correctly,
the new `x1` coordinate will lie between 0 and 1 (i.e., `0 < upper_x <= 1.0`).
Add a \gref{postcondition}{postcondition} to check that this is true.
Do the same for the new `y1` coordinate, `upper_y`.

Running `normalize_rectangle` for a short, wide rectangle should pass your new
preconditions and postconditions:

```python
import geometry


geometry.normalize_rectangle([2, 5, 3, 10])
```

```text
(0, 0, 0.2, 1.0)
```

but will fail for a tall, skinny rectangle:

```python
geometry.normalize_rectangle([20, 15, 30, 20])
```

```text
AssertionError                  Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-3-f4e8cdf7f69d> in <module>
----> 1 geometry.normalize_rectangle([20, 15, 30, 20])

~/Desktop/exercises/geometry.py in normalize_rectangle(rect)
     19
     20     assert 0 < upper_x <= 1.0, \
     21         'Calculated upper X coordinate invalid'
---> 22     assert 0 < upper_y <= 1.0, \
     23         'Calculated upper Y coordinate invalid'
     24
     25     return (0, 0, upper_x, upper_y)

AssertionError: Calculated upper Y coordinate invalid
```

3. Find and correct the source of the error in `normalize_rectangle`.
Once fixed, you should be able to successfully run
`geometry.normalize_rectangle([20, 15, 30, 20])`.

4. Write a unit test for tall, skinny rectangles and save it in a new file called
`test_geometry.py`. Run `pytest` to make sure the test passes.

5. Add a couple more unit tests to `test_geometry.py`.
Explain the rationale behind each test.

### Testing with randomness {#testing-ex-random}

Programs that rely on random numbers are impossible to test
because there's (deliberately) no way to predict their output.
Luckily, computer programs don't actually use random numbers:
they use a \gref{pseudo-random number generator}{prng} (PRNG)
that produces values in a repeatable but unpredictable way.
Given the same initial \gref{seed}{seed},
a PRNG will always produce the same sequence of values.
How can we use this fact when testing programs that rely on pseudo-random numbers?

### Testing with relative error {#testing-ex-relative-error}

If E is the expected result of a function and A is the actual value it produces,
the \gref{relative error}{relative_error} is `abs((A-E)/E)`.
This means that if we expect the results of tests to be 2, 1, and 0,
and we actually get 2.1, 1.1, and 0.1
the relative errors are 5%, 10%, and infinity.
Why does this seem counter-intuitive,
and what might be a better way to measure error in this case?

## Key Points {#testing-keypoints}

```{r, child="keypoints/testing.md"}
```
