## Introduction {#finale-intro}

Ever since @Wing2006 introduced the term "computational thinking" in 2006,
computer scientists and educators have debated what exactly it means @Denn2017.
What isn't debated is the fact that
programmers tend to think about problems in ways inspired by programming.
This paper describes ten of those ways
which may help people in other domains see their own problems with fresh eyes.

*An early version of this paper was inspired by Jon Udell's essay
"Seven Ways to Think Like the Web" @Udel2011.*

## Programs are data. {#finale-programs-data}

The key insight that all of modern computing is built on is that
programs are just another kind of data. Source code is text, no
different from a thesis or a poem; it can be searched with the same
tools used to search other kinds of documents, and new text (such as
documentation) can be generated from old.

More importantly, once a program is loaded into memory its instructions
are just bytes, no different in principle or practice from those used to
represent the pixels in an image or the numbers in a vector field. Those
blocks of instructions can be stored in data structures, passed to
functions, or altered on the fly, just like other data. Almost all
advanced programming techniques depend on this fact, from function
pointers in C and callbacks in JavaScript to decorators in Python and
lazy evaluation in R.

## Computers don't understand anything. {#finale-understand}

Computers don't understand: they only obey instructions that make them
appear to. If a person looks at Figure \@ref(fig:finale-data), they see the word "data":

```{r finale-data, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="The Word 'Data'"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/finale/data.png")
```

A machine doesn't; it doesn't even see four blobs of blue pixels on a
gray background, because it doesn't "see" anything. Equally, calling a
variable "temperature" doesn't mean the computer will store a
temperature in it---it would do exactly the same thing if the variable was
called "pressure" or "frankenstein" or "a7". This may seem obvious once
you have written a few programs, but thirty years after @Pea1986 first
called it the "superbug", believing that the computer will somehow
understand intent remains a common error.

## Programming is about creating and combining abstractions. {#finale-abstractions}

Computers don't have to understand instructions in order to execute
them, but we do in order to create them (and fix them afterward). Since
our working memory can only juggle a handful of things at once
@Mill1956, we have to create abstractions so that our representations
of problems will fit into hardware whose performance doubles over
millions of years rather than every eighteen months.

The key to making workable abstractions is to separate "what" from
"how", or in computing terms, to separate *interface* and
*implementation*. An interface is what something knows how to do; its
implementation is how it does those things. There can be dozens of
different implementations of a single interface: if we do our work well,
we shouldn't have to care about the differences between them until
something goes wrong or we need to improve its performance.

## Every redundancy in software is an abstraction trying to be born. {#finale-redundancy}

The history of programming is in part the history of people noticing
patterns and then making it easier for programmers to use them. Does
your program repeatedly search an array to find the largest and smallest
values? Write a function called `bounds`. Does it repeatedly search
arbitrary data structures to find values that meet certain criteria?
Write a generator that returns values one by one and another function
that filters those according to some criteria.

The problem with eliminating redundancy is that it can make software
denser, which in turn makes it harder for non-specialists to understand.
Like mathematics and modern art, it can take years of training for
someone to reach the point where they can see how beautiful something
is.

The other problem with patterns is that they can lead to expert blind
spot @Nath2003. Once experts have internalized patterns, they are
often unable to remember that they ever saw the world any other way, or
to see the world afresh through novice eyes. As a result, they are prone
to say, "It's obvious," and then follow it with incomprehensible jargon.

## Create models for computers and views for human beings. {#finale-models-views}

One consequence of the second and third rules is important enough to be
a rule in its own right: we should create models for computers and views
for human beings. A *model* is a precise, detailed representation of
information that is easy for a computer to operate on; a *view* is a way
of displaying information that human beings can easily understand and
interact with. For example, an HTML page is represented in memory as a
data structure containing nodes for elements like headings and
paragraphs, which can in turn contain a mix of other nodes or text
(Figure \@ref(fig:finale-modelview)).

```{r finale-modelview, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Model-View Separation"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/finale/modelview.png")
```

That model can be rendered in a browser, turned into speech, or
displayed as text using angle brackets. None of these *is* the model:
they're all views that make the information in the model comprehensible
in different ways.

Turning a model into a view is hard, but turning a view back into a
model is harder. For example, parsing the textual representation of HTML
takes thousands of lines of code, but doing OCR or speech recognition to
translate a rendered page or its spoken equivalent back into nodes and
text can take millions. Ironically, the same programmers who insist on
this separation in software they build for the rest of humanity have
been remarkably resistant to the idea of adopting any kind of model-view
separation in programming itself.

## Paranoia makes us productive. {#finale-paranoia}

"I want to count the cells in this photograph" is easy to say, but what
does it actually mean? What constitutes a cell? When do you decide that
a lumpy blob of pixels is two cells rather than one, or three instead of
two? Every program embodies decisions like these; the sooner these
decisions are made explicit and the earlier they're checked, the more
productive we will be. The precise order of steps doesn't seem to
matter: we can write tests, then write software to make those tests
pass, or write the program first and then test it. What *does* matter is
alternating development and testing in short interleaved bursts
@Fucc2017.

Of course, we don't stop worrying once we've typed our code in. We check
that data is formatted properly to protect ourselves against "garbage
in, garbage out". We put checks in our code to make sure that parameters
are sensible, data structures consistent, files aren't empty, and so on.
This is called *defensive programming*, and one of the signs of a mature
programmer is a high density of assertions and other self-checks in her
code. It is harder to do this in research software than in most
commercial software because (almost by definition) we don't know what
the right answer *is* in research software, which makes it difficult to
check that we're getting it.

## Things that don't change are easier to understand than things that do. {#finale-immutable}

Programmers use the words *mutable* and *immutable* to refer to things
that can be modified after they are created and things that cannot.
Immutable things are easier to understand because you don't have to
re-trace their history in order to understand their state. However,
immutable data can be less efficient than mutable data: for example,
it's very expensive to make a copy of an entire multi-megabyte image
just because we want to change one pixel.

Older programming languages like C and Fortran allowed most data to be
mutable because computer time was expensive. This led to many
hard-to-find bugs, so newer languages either make data immutable or
automatically copy data when asked to make changes in order to give the
appearance of immutability.

One special case of this rule is automating workflows. As @Whit1958
said, "Civilization advances by extending the number of important
operations which we can perform without thinking about them." Every time
we automate a task---i.e., make its steps immutable---we reduce the chances
of getting it wrong the next time, and have more time to think about
things that machines *can't* do for us.

## Better algorithms are better than better hardware. {#finale-algorithms}

One of the greatest mathematical advances of the Twentieth Century was
the idea of *algorithmic complexity*. The key insight is that the
running time or memory requirements of an algorithm grow in a
predictable way as a function of the size of the problem we are trying
to solve @Cone2016. Some algorithms slow down gently as their inputs
get larger, but others slow down so much that even if the whole universe
was one large computer, it couldn't solve any interesting problem.
Faster chips are therefore very welcome, but the real key to speed is to
focus on how we're doing things.

## Distributed is different. {#finale-distributed}

Distributed computing is intrinsically different from running a program
on a single machine @Wald1994. On a single computer, we can usually
pretend that nobody else is modifying the data while we're trying to use
it. Once our data is distributed, that simplification breaks down, and
we have to worry about things like someone else adding records to the
database between the time we ask how many there are and the time we
start processing them.

Similarly, we can pretend that a program running on a single computer
either works or doesn't. When that same program is accessing remote
resources, we have to worry about whether a long delay means that
something has failed, or whether it's just being slow. Many attempts
have been made to paper over these differences, but all have failed in
the large. As a result, the future of programming is about how we deal
with this---a statement that has been true since the 1980s

## Privacy, security, fairness, and responsibility can't be added after the fact. {#finale-privacy}

Our final rule may be the most important of all. As the last few years
have shown, collecting and interpreting data is never a neutral
activity: who we share data with, how we classify it, and most
importantly, who gets to decide these things are all political decisions
with ever-increasing impact, and we are past the point where we can
pretend otherwise.

Attempts to add privacy, security, and fairness to systems after they
have been built and deployed have repeatedly failed. The other "future
of programming" is therefore to take digital health as seriously as
physical health, and to make those responsible for it as accountable as
those responsible for other aspects of our wellbeing.

## Summary {#finale-summary}

Artisans have known for centuries that the tool shapes the hand.
If computers are tools for thinking with,
then it shouldn't surprise us that writing software shapes the minds of those who do it.
The ten rules listed above are just a few reflections of this;
we hope that they,
and the skills and tools taught in these lessons,
will help you see the world in new ways.
