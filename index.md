# Welcome {.unnumbered}

> It's still magic even if you know how it's done.
>
> --- Terry Pratchett\index{Pratchett, Terry}

Software is now as essential to research as telescopes, test tubes, and reference libraries.
This means that researchers *need* to know how to build, check, use, and share programs.
However,
most introductions to programming focus on developing commercial applications,
not on exploring problems whose answers aren't yet known.
Our goal is to show you how to do that,
both on your own and as part of a team.

We believe every researcher should know
how to write short programs that clean and analyze data in a reproducible way
and how to use version control to keep track of what they have done.
But just as some astronomers spend their careers designing telescopes,
some researchers focus on building the software that makes research possible.
People who do this are called \gref{research software engineers}{rse};
the aim of this book is to get you ready for this role by helping you go from
writing code for yourself to creating tools that help your entire field advance.

## The Big Picture {#intro-big-picture}

Our approach to research software engineering is based on three related concepts:

-   \gref{Open science}{open_science}: Making data, methods, and results
    freely available to all by publishing them under \gref{open
    licenses}{open_license}.

-   \gref{Reproducible research}{reproducible_research}: Ensuring that anyone
    with access to the data and software can feasibly reproduce results, both to
    check them and to build on them. 

-   \gref{Sustainable software}{sustainable_software}: The ease with which to
    maintain and extend it rather than to replace it. Sustainability isn't
    just a property of the software: it also depends on the skills and culture
    of its users.

People often conflate these three ideas,
but they are distinct.
For example,
if you share your data and the programs that analyze it,
but don't document what steps to take in what order,
your work is open but not reproducible.
Conversely,
if you completely automate your analysis,
but your data is only available to people in your lab,
your work is reproducible but not open.
Finally,
if a software package is being maintained by a couple of post-docs
who are being paid a fraction of what they could earn in industry
and have no realistic hope of promotion because their field doesn't value tool building,
then sooner or later it will become \gref{abandonware}{abandonware},
at which point openness and reproducibility become less relevant.

Nobody argues that research should be irreproducible or unsustainable,
but "not against it" and actively supporting it are very different things.
Academia doesn't yet know how to reward people for writing useful software,
so while you may be thanked,
the effort you put in may not translate into academic job security or decent pay.

Some people worry that if they make their data and code publicly available,
someone else will use it and publish a result they could have come up with themselves.
This is almost unheard of in practice,
but that doesn't stop it being used as a scare tactic.
Other people are afraid of looking foolish or incompetent by sharing code that might contain bugs.
This isn't just \gref{impostor syndrome}{impostor_syndrome}:
members of marginalized groups are frequently judged more harshly than others,
so being wrong in public is much riskier for them.

With this course, we hope to give researchers the tools and knowledge to be
better research software developers, to be more efficient in their work, make
less mistakes, and work more openly and reproducibly.
We hope that by having more researchers with these skills and knowledge,
research culture can improve to address the issues raised above.

## Intended Audience {#intro-personas}

This book is written for researchers who are already using Python for their data analysis,
but who want to take their coding and software development to the next level.
You don't have to be highly proficient with Python,
but you should already be comfortable doing things like reading data from files
and writing loops, conditionals, and functions.
The following personas are examples of the types of people
that are our target audience.

Amira Khan
:   completed a master's in library science five years ago
    and has since worked for a small aid organization.
    She did some statistics during her degree,
    and has learned some R and Python by doing data science courses online,
    but has no formal training in programming.
    Amira would like to tidy up the scripts, datasets, and reports she has created
    in order to share them with her colleagues.
    These lessons will show her how to do this.

Jun Hsu
:   completed an [Insight Data Science][insight] fellowship last year after doing a PhD in geology
    and now works for a company that does forensic audits.
    He uses a variety of machine learning and visualization packages,
    and would now like to turn some of his own work into an open source project.
    This book will show him how such a project should be organized
    and how to encourage people to contribute to it.

Sami Virtanen
:   became a competent programmer during a bachelor's degree in applied math
    and was then hired by the university's research computing center.
    The kinds of applications they are being asked to support
    have shifted from fluid dynamics to data analysis;
    this guide will teach them how to build and run data pipelines
    so that they can pass those skills on to their users.

## What You Will Learn {#intro-syllabus}

Rather than simply providing reference material about good coding practices,
the book follows Amira and Sami as they work together to write an actual software package
to address a real research question.
The data analysis task that we focus on
relates to a fascinating result in the field of quantitative linguistics.
[Zipf's Law][zipfs-law] states that the second most common word in a body of text
appears half as often as the most common,
the third most common appears a third as often, and so on.
To test whether Zipf's Law holds for a collection of classic novels
that are freely available from [Project Gutenberg][project-gutenberg],
we write a software package that counts and analyzes the word frequency distribution
in any arbitrary body of text.

In the process of writing and publishing a Python package to verify Zipf's Law,
we will show you how to do the following:

-   Organize small and medium-sized data science projects.
-   Use the Unix shell to efficiently manage your data and code.
-   Write Python programs that can be used on the command line.
-   Use Git and GitHub to track and share your work.
-   Work productively in a small team where everyone is welcome.
-   Use Make to automate complex workflows.
-   Enable users to configure your software without modifying it directly.
-   Test your software and know which parts have not yet been tested.
-   Find, handle, and fix errors in your code.
-   Publish your code and research in open and reproducible ways.
-   Create Python packages that can be installed in standard ways.

## Using this Book  {#intro-using}

This book was written to be used as the material for a (potentially) semester-long
course at the university level,
although it can also be used for independent self-study.
Participatory live-coding is the anticipated style for teaching the material,
rather than lectures simply talking about the code presented [@Brow2018; @Wils2018].
The chapters and their content are generally designed to be used in the order
given.

Chapters are structured with the introduction at the start, content in the middle,
and exercises at the end. Callout boxes are interspersed throughout the content
to be used as a supplement to the main text,
but not a requirement for the course overall.
Early chapters have many small exercises;
later chapters have fewer but larger exercises.
In order to break up long periods of live-coding while teaching,
it may be preferable to stop and complete some of the exercises
at key points throughout the chapter,
rather than waiting until the end. 
Possible exercise solutions are provided (AppendixÂ \@ref(solutions)),
in addition to learning objectives (Appendix \@ref(objectives)) 
and key points (Appendix \@ref(keypoints)) for each chapter.

# Getting Started {#getting-started}

> Everything starts somewhere, though many physicists disagree.
>
> --- Terry Pratchett\index{Pratchett, Terry}

As with many research projects,
the first step in our Zipf's Law analysis
is to download the research data
and install the required software.
Before doing that,
it's worth taking a moment to think about
how we are going to organize everything.
We will soon have a number of books from [Project Gutenberg][project-gutenberg]
in the form of a series of text files,
plots we've produced showing the word frequency distribution in each book,
as well as the code we've written to produce those plots
and to document and release our software package.
If we aren't organized from the start,
things could get messy later on.

## Project Structure {#getting-started-structure}

Project organization is like a diet:
everyone has one,
it's just a question of whether it's healthy or not.
In the case of a project,
"healthy" means that people can find what they need and do what they want without becoming frustrated.
This depends on how well organized the project is
and how familiar people are with that style of organization.

As with good coding style,
small pieces in predictable places with readable names are easier to find and use
than large chunks that vary from project to project and have names like "stuff".
We can be messy while we are working and then tidy up later,
but experience teaches that we will be more productive if we make tidiness a habit.

In building the Zipf's Law project,
we'll follow a widely used template
for organizing small and medium-sized data analysis projects [@Nobl2009].
The project will live in a directory called `zipf`,
which will also be a Git repository stored on GitHub (ChapterÂ \@ref(git-cmdline)).
The following is an abbreviated version of the project directory tree
as it appears toward the end of the book:

```text
zipf/
âââ .gitignore
âââ CITATION.md
âââ CONDUCT.md
âââ CONTRIBUTING.md
âââ LICENSE.md
âââ README.md
âââ Makefile
âââ bin
â   âââ book_summary.sh
â   âââ collate.py
â   âââ countwords.py
â   âââ ...
âââ data
â   âââ README.md
â   âââ dracula.txt
â   âââ frankenstein.txt
â   âââ ...
âââ docs
â   âââ ...
âââ results
â   âââ collated.csv
â   âââ dracula.csv
â   âââ dracula.png
â   âââ ...
âââ ...
```

The full, final directory tree is documented in AppendixÂ \@ref(tree).

### Standard information {#getting-started-boilerplate}

Our project will contain a few standard files
that should be present in every research software project,
open source or otherwise:

-   `README` includes basic information on our project.
     We'll create it in ChapterÂ \@ref(git-advanced),
     and extend it in ChapterÂ \@ref(packaging).

-   `LICENSE` is the project's license. We'll add it in SectionÂ \@ref(teams-license).

-   `CONTRIBUTING` explains how to contribute to the project. We'll add it in SectionÂ \@ref(teams-documentation).

-   `CONDUCT` is the project's Code of Conduct. We'll add it in SectionÂ \@ref(teams-coc).

-   `CITATION` explains how to cite the software. We'll add it in SectionÂ \@ref(packaging-software-journals).

Some projects also include a `CONTRIBUTORS` or `AUTHORS` file that
lists everyone who has contributed to the project,
while others include that information in the `README` (we do this in ChapterÂ \@ref(git-advanced))
or make it a section in `CITATION`.
These files are often called \gref{boilerplate}{boilerplate},
meaning they are copied without change from one use to the next.

### Organizing project content {#getting-started-organize}

Following @Nobl2009,
the directories in the repository's root are organized according to purpose:

-   Runnable programs go in `bin/`
    (an old Unix abbreviation for "binary", meaning "not text").
    This will include both shell scripts,
    e.g., `book_summary.sh` developed in ChapterÂ \@ref(bash-advanced),
    and Python programs,
    e.g., `countwords.py`, developed in ChapterÂ \@ref(scripting).

-   Raw data goes in `data/`
    and is never modified after being stored.
    You'll set up this directory
    and its contents in SectionÂ \@ref(getting-started-download-data).

-   Results are put in `results/`.
    This includes cleaned-up data,
    figures,
    and everything else created using what's in `bin` and `data`.
    In this project,
    we'll describe exactly how `bin` and `data` are used
    with `Makefile` created in ChapterÂ \@ref(automate).

-   Finally,
    documentation and manuscripts go in `docs/`.
    In this project,
    `docs` will contain automatically generated
    documentation for the Python package, created in
    SectionÂ \@ref(packaging-sphinx).

This structure works well for many computational research projects and
we encourage its use beyond just this book.
We will add some more folders and files not directly addressed by @Nobl2009
when we talk about testing (ChapterÂ \@ref(testing)),
provenance (ChapterÂ \@ref(provenance)),
and packaging (ChapterÂ \@ref(packaging)).

## Downloading the Data {#getting-started-download-data}

The data files used in the book are archived
at an online repository called Figshare (which we discuss in detail in SectionÂ \@ref(provenance-data-where))
and can be accessed at:

<https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.13040516>

We can download a zip file containing the data files by clicking
"download all" at this URL
and then unzipping the contents into a new `zipf/data` directory
(also called a \gref{folder}{folder})
that follows the project structure described above.
Here's how things look once we're done:

```text
zipf/
âââ data
    âââ README.md
    âââ dracula.txt
    âââ frankenstein.txt
    âââ jane_eyre.txt
    âââ moby_dick.txt
    âââ sense_and_sensibility.txt
    âââ sherlock_holmes.txt
    âââ time_machine.txt
```

## Installing the Software {#getting-started-install-software}

In order to conduct our analysis, we need to install the following software:

1. A \gref{Bash shell}{shell}
2. \gref{Git}{git} version control
3. A text editor
4. [PythonÂ 3][python] (via the Anaconda distribution)
5. [GNU Make][gnu-make]

Comprehensive software installation instructions for Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems
(with video tutorials) are maintained by [The Carpentries][carpentries]
as part of their workshop website template at:

<https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#setup>

We can follow those instructions to install the Bash shell, Git, a text editor and Anaconda.
We recommend Anaconda as the method for installing Python,
as it includes Conda as well as many of the packages we'll use in this book.

You can check if Make is already on your computer by typing `make -v` into the Bash shell.
If it is not, you can install it as follows:

- *Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)*: Install it from the Bash shell using `sudo apt-get install make`.
- *Mac*: Install [Xcode][xcode] (via the App Store).
- *Windows*: Follow the [installation instructions][ubc-mds-make-windows] maintained by the
  Master of Data Science program at the University of British Columbia.

> **conda in the Shell on Windows**
>
> If you are using Windows and the `conda` command isn't available at the Bash shell,
> you'll need to open the Anaconda Prompt program (via the Windows start menu)
> and run the command `conda init bash` (this only needs to be done once).
> After that, your shell will be configured to use conda going forward.

> **Software Versions**
> 
> Throughout the book,
> we'll be showing you examples of the output you can expect to see.
> This output is derived from running a Mac with:
> Git version 2.29.2, Python version 3.7.6,
> GNU bash version 3.2.57(1)-release (x86_64-apple-darwin19),
> GNU Make 3.81, and conda 4.9.2.
> In some cases,
> what you see printed to the screen may differ slightly 
> based on software version.
> We'll help you understand how to interpret the output
> so you can keep working and troubleshoot regardless of software version.

## Summary {#getting-started-summary}

Now that our project structure is set up,
our data is downloaded,
and our software is installed,
we are ready to start our analysis.

\newpage

## Exercises {#getting-started-exercises}

### Getting ready {#getting-started-install}

Make sure you've downloaded the required data files
(following Section \@ref(getting-started-download-data))
and installed the required software (following Section \@ref(getting-started-install-software))
before progressing to the next chapter.

## Key Points {#getting-started-keypoints}


- Make tidiness a habit, rather than cleaning up your project files later.
- Include a few standard files in all your projects, such as README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, CONDUCT and CITATION.
- Put runnable code in a `bin/` directory.
- Put raw/original data in a `data/` directory and never modify it.
- Put results in a `results/` directory. This includes cleaned-up data and figures (i.e., everything created using what's in `bin` and `data`).
- Put documentation and manuscripts in a `docs/` directory.
- Refer to The Carpentries [software installation guide][carpentries-install-instructions] if you're having trouble.

# The Basics of the Unix Shell {#bash-basics}

> Ninety percent of most magic merely consists of knowing one extra fact.
>
> --- Terry Pratchett\index{Pratchett, Terry}

Computers do four basic things:
store data,
run programs,
talk with each other,
and interact with people.
They do the interacting in many different ways,
of which \gref{graphical user interfaces}{gui} (GUIs) are the most widely used.
The computer displays icons to show our files and programs,
and we tell it to copy or run those by clicking with a mouse.
GUIs are easy to learn but hard to automate,
and don't create a record of what we did.

In contrast,
when we use a \gref{command-line interface}{cli} (CLI)\index{command-line interface}\index{CLI (command-line interface)}
we communicate with the computer by typing commands,
and the computer responds by displaying text.
CLIs existed long before GUIs;
they have survived because they are efficient,
easy to automate,
and automatically record what we have done.

The heart of every CLI is a \gref{read-evaluate-print loop}{repl} (REPL).\index{read-eval-print loop}\index{REPL (read-eval-print loop)}
When we type a command and press <kbd>Return</kbd> (also called <kbd>Enter</kbd>)
the CLI **r**eads the command,
**e**valuates it (i.e., executes it),
**p**rints the command's output,
and **l**oops around to wait for another command.
If you have used an interactive console for Python,
you have already used a simple CLI.

This lesson introduces another CLI that lets us interact with our computer's operating system.
It is called a "command shell",
or just \gref{shell}{shell} for short,\index{Unix shell}
and in essence is a program that runs other programs on our behalf
(FigureÂ \@ref(fig:bash-basics-repl)).
Those "other programs" can do things as simple as telling us the time
or as complex as modeling global climate change;
as long as they obey a few simple rules,
the shell can run them without having to know what language they are written in
or how they do what they do.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/bash-basics/the-shell.png" alt="The Bash shell." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:bash-basics-repl)The Bash shell.</p>
</div>

> **What's in a Name?**
>
> Programmers have written many different shells over the last forty years,
> just as they have created many different text editors and plotting packages.
> The most popular shell today is called Bash\index{Bash}\index{Unix shell!Bash}
> (an acronym of **B**ourne **A**gain **SH**ell,
> and a weak pun on the name of its predecessor,
> the Bourne shell).
> Other shells may differ from Bash in minor ways,
> but the core commands and ideas remain the same.
> In particular,
> the most recent versions of MacOS use a shell called the Z Shell or `zsh`;
> we will point out a few differences as we go along.

Please see SectionÂ \@ref(getting-started-install-software) for instructions
on how to install and launch the shell on your computer.

## Exploring Files and Directories {#bash-basics-explore}

Our first shell commands will let us explore our folders and files,
and will also introduce us to several conventions that most Unix tools follow.
To start,
when Bash runs it presents us with a \gref{prompt}{prompt}\index{prompt (in Unix shell)}
to indicate that it is waiting for us to type something.
This prompt is a simple dollar sign by default:

```bash
$
```

However,
different shells may use a different symbol:
in particular,
the `zsh` shell, which is the default on newer versions of MacOS, uses `%`.
As we'll see in SectionÂ \@ref(bash-advanced-vars),
we can customize the prompt to give us more information.

> **Don't Type the Dollar Sign**
>
> We show the `$` prompt so that it's clear what you are supposed to type,
> particularly when several commands appear in a row,
> but you should *not* type it yourself.

Let's run a command to find out who the shell thinks we are:

```bash
$ whoami
```

```text
amira
```

> **Learn by Doing**
>
> Amira is one of the learners described in SectionÂ \@ref(intro-personas).
> For the rest of the book,
> we'll present code and examples from her perspective.
> You should follow along on your own computer,
> though what you see might deviate in small ways because of differences in operating system
> (and because your name probably isn't Amira).

Now that we know who we are,
we can explore where we are and what we have.
The part of the operating system that manages files and directories (also called \gref{folders}{folder})
is called the \gref{filesystem}{filesystem}.\index{filesystem}
Some of the most commonly used commands in the shell create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories.
Let's start exploring them by running the command `pwd`,\index{Unix commands!pwd}
which stands for **p**rint **w**orking **d**irectory.
The "print" part of its name is straightforward;
the "working directory" part refers to the fact that
the shell keeps track of our \gref{current working directory}{current_working_directory} at all times.\index{current working directory}
Most commands read and write files in the current working directory
unless we tell them to do something else,
so knowing where we are before running a command is important.

```bash
$ pwd
```

```text
/Users/amira
```

Here,
the computer's response is `/Users/amira`,
which tells us that we are in a directory called `amira`
that is contained in a top-level directory called `Users`.
This directory is Amira's \gref{home directory}{home_directory};\index{home directory}
to understand what that means,
we must first understand how the filesystem is organized.
On Amira's computer
it looks like FigureÂ \@ref(fig:bash-basics-filesystem).

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/bash-basics/sample-filesystem.png" alt="A sample filesystem." width="70%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:bash-basics-filesystem)A sample filesystem.</p>
</div>

At the top is the \gref{root directory}{root_directory} that holds everything else,\index{root directory}
which we can refer to using a slash character `/` on its own.
Inside that directory are several other directories,
including `bin` (where some built-in programs are stored),
`data` (for miscellaneous data files),
`tmp` (for temporary files that don't need to be stored long-term),
and `Users` (where users' personal directories are located).
We know that `/Users` is stored inside the root directory `/` because its name begins with `/`,
and that our current working directory `/Users/amira` is stored inside `/Users`
because `/Users` is the first part of its name.
A name like this is called a \gref{path}{path} because it tells us\index{path}
how to get from one place in the filesystem (e.g., the root directory)
to another (e.g., Amira's home directory).

Underneath `/Users`,
we find one directory for each user with an account on this machine.
Jun's files are stored in `/Users/jun`,
Sami's in `/Users/sami`,
and Amira's in `/Users/amira`.
This is where the name "home directory" comes from:
when we first log in,
the shell puts us in the directory that holds our files.

> Our examples show what we would see on MacOS.

Now that we know where we are,
let's see what we have using the command `ls`\index{Unix commands!ls}
(short for "listing"),
which prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory:

```bash
$ ls
```

```text
Applications   Downloads     Music        todo.txt
Desktop        Library       Pictures     zipf
Documents      Movies        Public       
```

Again,
our results may be different depending on our operating system
and what files or directories we have.

We can make the output of `ls` more informative using the `-F` \gref{option}{command_line_option}\index{option (of shell command)}\index{command-line option}
(also sometimes called a \gref{switch}{command_line_switch} or a \gref{flag}{command_line_flag}).
Options are exactly like arguments to a function in Python;
in this case,
`-F` tells `ls` to decorate its output to show what things are.
A trailing `/` indicates a directory,
while a trailing `*` tells us something is a runnable program.
Depending on our setup,
the shell might also use colors to indicate whether each entry is a file or directory.

```bash
$ ls -F
```

```text
Applications/   Downloads/     Music/        todo.txt
Desktop/        Library/       Pictures/     zipf/
Documents/      Movies/        Public/       
```

Here,
we can see that almost everything in our home directory is a \gref{subdirectory}{subdirectory};\index{subdirectory}
the only thing that isn't is a file called `todo.txt`.

Some options tell a command how to behave,
but others tell it what to act on.
For example,
if we want to see what's in the `/Users` directory,
we can type:

```bash
$ ls /Users
```

```text
amira   jun     sami
```

We often call the file and directory names that we give to commands \gref{arguments}{command_line_argument}\index{argument (of shell command)}
to distinguish them from the built-in options.
We can combine options and arguments:

```bash
$ ls -F /Users
```

```text
amira/  jun/    sami/
```

but we must put the options (like `-F`)
before the names of any files or directories we want to work on,
because once the command encounters something that *isn't* an option
it assumes there aren't any more:

```bash
$ ls /Users -F
```

```text
ls: -F: No such file or directory
amira   jun     sami
```

## Moving Around {#bash-basics-navigate}

Let's run `ls` again.
Without any arguments,
it shows us what's in our current working directory:

```bash
$ ls -F
```

```text
Applications/   Downloads/     Music/        todo.txt
Desktop/        Library/       Pictures/     zipf/
Documents/      Movies/        Public/       
```

If we want to see what's in the `zipf` directory
we can ask `ls` to list its contents:

```bash
$ ls -F zipf
```

```text
data/
```

Notice that `zipf` doesn't have a leading slash before its name.
This absence tells the shell that it is a \gref{relative path}{relative_path},\index{relative path}\index{path!relative}
i.e.,
that it identifies something starting from our current working directory.
In contrast,
a path like `/Users/amira` is an \gref{absolute path}{absolute_path}:\index{absolute path}\index{path!absolute}
it is always interpreted from the root directory down,
so it always refers to the same thing.
Using a relative path is like telling someone to go two kilometers north and then half a kilometer east;
using an absolute path is like giving them the latitude and longitude of their destination.

We can use whichever kind of path is easiest to type,
but if we are going to do a lot of work with the data in the `zipf` directory,
the easiest thing would be to change our current working directory
so that we don't have to type `zipf` over and over again.
The command to do this is `cd`,\index{Unix commands!cd}
which stands for **c**hange **d**irectory.
This name is a bit misleading because the command doesn't change the directory;
instead, it changes the shell's idea of what directory we are in.
Let's try it out:

```bash
$ cd zipf
```

`cd` doesn't print anything.
This is normal:
many shell commands run silently unless something goes wrong,
on the theory that they should only ask for our attention when they need it.
To confirm that `cd` has done what we asked,
we can use `pwd`:

```bash
$ pwd
```

```text
/Users/amira/zipf
```

```bash
$ ls -F
```

```text
data/
```

> -bash: cd: whoops: No such file or directory

We now know how to go down the directory tree,
but how do we go up?
This doesn't work:

```bash
$ cd amira
```

```text
cd: amira: No such file or directory
```

because `amira` on its own is a relative path meaning
"a file or directory called `amira` *below our current working directory.*"
To get back home,
we can either use an absolute path:

```bash
$ cd /Users/amira
```

or a special relative path called `..` (two periods in a row with no spaces),\index{.. (parent directory)}\index{path!..}
which always means "the directory that contains the current one."
The directory that contains the one we are in is called the \gref{parent directory}{parent_directory},\index{parent directory}
and sure enough,
`..` gets us there:

```bash
$ cd ..
$ pwd
```

```text
/Users/amira
```

`ls` usually doesn't show us this special directory---since it's always there,
displaying it every time would be a distraction.
We can ask `ls` to include it using the `-a` option,
which stands for "all".
Remembering that we are now in `/Users/amira`:

```bash
$ ls -F -a
```

```text
./              Documents/     Music/        zipf/
../             Downloads/     Pictures/     
Applications/   Library/       Public/ 
Desktop/        Movies/        todo.txt
```

The output also shows another special directory called `.` (a single period),\index{path!.}\index{. (current working directory)}
which refers to the current working directory.
It may seem redundant to have a name for it,
but we'll see some uses for it soon.

The special names `.` and `..` don't belong to `cd`:
they mean the same thing to every program.
For example,
if we are in `/Users/amira/zipf`,
then `lsÂ ..` will display a listing of `/Users/amira`.
When the meanings of the parts are the same no matter how they're combined,
programmers say they are \gref{orthogonal}{orthogonality}.
Orthogonal systems tend to be easier for people to learn
because there are fewer special cases to remember.

`cd` is a simple command,
but it allows us to explore several new ideas.
First,
several `..` can be joined by the path separator
to move higher than the parent directory in a single step.
For example, `cdÂ ../..` will move us up two directories
(e.g., from `/Users/amira/zipf` to `/Users`),
while `cdÂ ../Movies` will move us up from `zipf` and back down into `Movies`.

What happens if we type `cd` on its own without giving a directory?

```bash
$ pwd
```

```text
/Users/amira/Movies
```

```bash
$ cd
$ pwd
```

```text
/Users/amira
```

No matter where we are,
`cd` on its own always returns us to our home directory.
We can achieve the same thing using the special directory name `~`,\index{\char`\~\ (home directory)}\index{home directory!\char`\~\ (alias for)}
which is a shortcut for our home directory:

```bash
$ ls ~
```

```text
Applications   Downloads     Music        todo.txt
Desktop        Library       Pictures     zipf
Documents      Movies        Public       
```

(`ls` doesn't show any trailing slashes here because we haven't used `-F`.)
We can use `~` in paths,
so that (for example) `~/Downloads` always refers to our download directory.

Finally,
`cd` interprets the shortcut `-` (a single dash) to mean the last directory we were in.
Using this is usually faster and more reliable than trying to remember and type the path,
but unlike `~`,
it only works with `cd`:
`lsÂ -` tries to print a listing of a directory called `-`
rather than showing us the contents of our previous directory.

## Creating New Files and Directories {#bash-basics-filedir}

We now know how to explore files and directories,
but how do we create them?
To find out,
let's go back to our `zipf` directory:

```bash
$ cd ~/zipf
$ ls -F
```

```text
data/
```

To create a new directory,
we use the command `mkdir` (short for **m**a**k**e **d**irectory):\index{Unix commands!mkdir}

```bash
$ mkdir docs
```

Since `docs` is a relative path
(i.e., does not have a leading slash)
the new directory is created below the current working directory:

```bash
$ ls -F
```

```text
data/  docs/
```

Using the shell to create a directory is no different than using a graphical tool.
If we look at the current directory with our computer's file browser
we will see the `docs` directory there too.
The shell and the file explorer are two different ways of interacting with the files;
the files and directories themselves are the same.

Since we just created the `docs` directory,
`ls` doesn't display anything when we ask for a listing of its contents:

```bash
$ ls -F docs
```

Let's change our working directory to `docs` using `cd`,
then use a very simple text editor called \gref{Nano}{nano_editor} to create a file called `draft.txt`\index{Nano editor}
(FigureÂ \@ref(fig:bash-basics-nano)):

```bash
$ cd docs
$ nano draft.txt
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/bash-basics/nano-editor.png" alt="The Nano editor." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:bash-basics-nano)The Nano editor.</p>
</div>

When we say "Nano is a text editor" we really do mean "text":
it can only work with plain character data,
not spreadsheets, images, Microsoft Word files, or anything else invented after 1970.
We use it in this lesson because it runs everywhere,
and because it is as simple as something can be and still be called an editor.
However,
that last trait means that we *shouldn't* use it for larger tasks
like writing a program or a paper.

>
> Unlike most modern editors,
> Nano runs *inside* the shell window instead of opening a new window of its own.
> This is a holdover from an era when graphical terminals were a rarity
> and different applications had to share a single screen.

Once Nano is open we can type in a few lines of text,
then press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>
(the Control key and the letter 'O' at the same time)
to save our work.
Nano will ask us what file we want to save it to;
press <kbd>Return</kbd> to accept the suggested default of `draft.txt`.
Once our file is saved,
we can use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> to exit the editor and return to the shell.

> **Control, Ctrl, or ^ Key**

> `^G Get Help` means "use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>G</kbd> to get help"
> and `^O WriteOut` means "use <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd> to write out the current file."

Nano doesn't leave any output on the screen after it exits,
but `ls` will show that we have indeed created a new file `draft.txt`:

```bash
$ ls
```

```text
draft.txt
```

## Moving Files and Directories {#bash-basics-move}

Let's go back to our `zipf` directory:

```bash
cd ~/zipf
```

The `docs` directory contains a file called `draft.txt`.
That isn't a particularly informative name,
so let's change it using `mv` (short for **m**o**v**e):\index{Unix commands!mv}

```bash
$ mv docs/draft.txt docs/prior-work.txt
```

The first argument tells `mv` what we are "moving",
while the second is where it's to go.
"Moving" `docs/draft.txt` to `docs/prior-work.txt`
has the same effect as renaming the file:

```bash
$ ls docs
```

```text
prior-work.txt
```

We must be careful when specifying the destination
because `mv` will overwrite existing files without warning.
An option `-i` (for "interactive") makes `mv` ask us for confirmation before overwriting.
`mv` also works on directories,
so `mv analysis first-paper` would rename the directory without changing its contents.

Now suppose we want to move `prior-work.txt` into the current working directory.
If we don't want to change the file's name,
just its location,
we can provide `mv` with a directory as a destination
and it will move the file there.
In this case,
the directory we want is the special name `.` that we mentioned earlier:

```bash
$ mv docs/prior-work.txt .
```

\newpage

`ls` now shows us that `docs` is empty:

```bash
$ ls docs
```

and that our current directory now contains our file:

```bash
$ ls
```

```text
data/  docs/  prior-work.txt
```

If we only want to check that the file exists,
we can give its name to `ls`
just like we can give the name of a directory:

```bash
$ ls prior-work.txt
```

```text
prior-work.txt
```

## Copying Files and Directories {#bash-basics-copy}

The `cp` command **c**o**p**ies files.\index{Unix commands!cp}
It works like `mv` except it creates a file instead of moving an existing one:

```bash
$ cp prior-work.txt docs/section-1.txt
```

We can check that `cp` did the right thing
by giving `ls` two arguments
to ask it to list two things at once:

```bash
$ ls prior-work.txt docs/section-1.txt
```

```text
docs/section-1.txt  prior-work.txt
```

Notice that `ls` shows the output in alphabetical order.
If we leave off the second filename and ask it to show us a file and a directory
(or multiple directories)
it lists them one by one:

```bash
$ ls prior-work.txt docs
```

```text
prior-work.txt

docs:
section-1.txt
```

Copying a directory and everything it contains is a little more complicated.
If we use `cp` on its own,
we get an error message:

```bash
$ cp docs backup
```

```text
cp: docs is a directory (not copied).
```

If we really want to copy everything,
we must give `cp` the `-r` option (meaning \gref{recursive}{recursion}):

```bash
$ cp -r docs backup
```

Once again we can check the result with `ls`:

```bash
$ ls docs backup
```

```text
docs/:
section-1.txt

backup/:
section-1.txt
```

## Deleting Files and Directories {#bash-basics-rm}

Let's tidy up by removing the `prior-work.txt` file we created in our `zipf` directory.
The command to do this is `rm` (for **r**e**m**ove):\index{Unix commands!rm}

```bash
$ rm prior-work.txt
```

We can confirm the file is gone using `ls`:

```bash
$ ls prior-work.txt
```

```text
ls: prior-work.txt: No such file or directory
```

Deleting is forever:
unlike most GUIs,
the Unix shell doesn't have a trash bin that we can recover deleted files from.
Tools for finding and recovering deleted files do exist,
but there is no guarantee they will work,
since the computer may recycle the file's disk space at any time.
In most cases,
when we delete a file it really is gone.

In a half-hearted attempt to stop us from erasing things accidentally,
`rm` refuses to delete directories:

```bash
$ rm docs
```

```text
rm: docs: is a directory
```

We can tell `rm` we really want to do this
by giving it the recursive option `-r`:

```bash
$ rm -r docs
```

`rm -r` should be used with great caution:
in most cases,
it's safest to add the `-i` option (for **i**nteractive)
to get `rm` to ask us to confirm each deletion.
As a halfway measure,
we can use `-v` (for **v**erbose)
to get `rm` to print a message for each file it deletes.
This option works the same way with `mv` and `cp`.

## Wildcards {#bash-basics-wildcard}

`zipf/data` contains the text files for several ebooks
from [Project Gutenberg][project-gutenberg]:

```bash
$ ls data
```

```text
README.md         moby_dick.txt
dracula.txt       sense_and_sensibility.txt
frankenstein.txt  sherlock_holmes.txt
jane_eyre.txt     time_machine.txt
```

The `wc` command (short for **w**ord **c**ount)\index{Unix commands!wc}
tells us how many lines, words, and letters there are in one file:

```bash
$ wc data/moby_dick.txt
```

```text
 22331  215832 1276222 data/moby_dick.txt
```

> **What's in a Word?**
>
> `wc` only considers spaces to be word breaks:
> if two words are connected by a long dash---like "dash" and "like"
> in this sentence---then `wc` will count them as one word.

We could run `wc` more times to find out how many lines there are in the other files,
but that would be a lot of typing
and we could easily make a mistake.
We can't just give `wc` the name of the directory as we do with `ls`:

```bash
$ wc data
```

```text
wc: data: read: Is a directory
```

Instead,
we can use \gref{wildcards}{wildcard} to specify a set of files at once.\index{wildcard!in Unix shell}
The most commonly used wildcard is `*` (a single asterisk).
It matches zero or more characters,
so `data/*.txt` matches all of the text files in the `data` directory:

```text
$ ls data/*.txt
```

```text
data/dracula.txt       data/sense_and_sensibility.txt
data/frankenstein.txt  data/sherlock_holmes.txt
data/jane_eyre.txt     data/time_machine.txt
data/moby_dick.txt
```

while `data/s*.txt` only matches the two whose names begin with an 's':

```bash
$ ls data/s*.txt
```

```text
data/sense_and_sensibility.txt  data/sherlock_holmes.txt
```

Wildcards are expanded to match filenames *before* commands are run,
so they work exactly the same way for every command.
This means that we can use them with `wc` to (for example)
count the number of words in the books with names that contain an underscore:

```bash
$ wc data/*_*.txt
```

```text
  21054  188460 1049294 data/jane_eyre.txt
  22331  215832 1253891 data/moby_dick.txt
  13028  121593  693116 data/sense_and_sensibility.txt
  13053  107536  581903 data/sherlock_holmes.txt
   3582   35527  200928 data/time_machine.txt
  73048  668948 3779132 total
```

or the number of words in Frankenstein:

```bash
$ wc data/frank*.txt
```

```text
  7832  78100 442967 data/frankenstein.txt
```

The exercises will introduce and explore other wildcards.
For now,
we only need to know that
it's possible for a wildcard expression to *not* match anything.
In this case,
the command will usually print an error message:

```bash
$ wc data/*.csv
```

```text
wc: data/*.csv: open: No such file or directory
```

## Reading the Manual {#bash-basics-help}

`wc` displays lines, words, and characters by default,
but we can ask it to display only the number of lines:

```bash
$ wc -l data/s*.txt
```

```text
  13028 sense_and_sensibility.txt
  13053 sherlock_holmes.txt
  26081 total
```

`wc` has other options as well.
We can use the `man` command (short for **man**ual)\index{Unix commands!man}\index{Unix shell!manual}
to find out what they are:

```bash
$ man wc
```

Manual pages contain a lot of information---often more than we really want.
FigureÂ \@ref(fig:bash-basics-manual)
includes excerpts from the manual on your screen,
and highlights a few of features useful for beginners.

Some commands have a `--help` option that provides a succinct summary of possibilities,
but the best place to go for help these days is probably the [TLDR][tldr] website.
The acronym stands for "too long, didn't read,"
and its help for `wc` displays this:

```
wc
Count words, bytes, or lines.

Count lines in file:
wc -l {{file}}

Count words in file:
wc -w {{file}}

Count characters (bytes) in file:
wc -c {{file}}

Count characters in file (taking multi-byte character sets into
account):
wc -m {{file}}

edit this page on github
```

As the last line suggests,
all of its examples are in a public GitHub repository
so that users like you can add the examples you wish it had.
For more information,
we can search on [Stack Overflow][so-bash]
or browse the [GNU manuals][gnu-man]
(particularly those for the [core GNU utilities][gnu-man-coreutils],
which include many of the commands introduced in this lesson).
In all cases,
though,
we need to have some idea of what we're looking for in the first place:
someone who wants to know how many lines there are in a data file
is unlikely to think to look for `wc`.

## Summary {#bash-basics-summary}

The original Unix shell is celebrating its fiftieth anniversary.
Its commands may be cryptic,
but few programs have remained in daily use for so long.
The next chapter will explore how we can combine and repeat commands
in order to create powerful, efficient workflows.

## Exercises {#bash-basics-exercises}

The exercises below involve creating and moving new files,
as well as considering hypothetical files.
Please note that if you create or move any files or directories in your Zipf's Law project,
you may want to reorganize your files following the outline at the beginning of the next chapter.
If you accidentally delete necessary files,
you can start with a fresh copy of the data files
by following the instructions in SectionÂ \@ref(getting-started-download-data).

### Exploring more `ls` flags {#bash-basics-ex-more-ls}

What does the command `ls` do when used
with the `-l` option?

What happens if you use two options at the same time, such as `ls -l -h`?

### Listing recursively and by time {#bash-basics-ex-ls-rt}

The command `ls -R` lists the contents of directories recursively,
which means the subdirectories, sub-subdirectories, and so on at each level are listed.
The command `ls -t` lists things by time of last change,
with most recently changed files or directories first.

In what order does `ls -R -t` display things? Hint: `ls -l` uses a long listing
format to view timestamps.

### Absolute and relative paths {#bash-basics-ex-paths}

Starting from `/Users/amira/data`,
which of the following commands could Amira use to navigate to her home directory,
which is `/Users/amira`?

1. `cd .`
2. `cd /`
3. `cd /home/amira`
4. `cd ../..`
5. `cd ~`
6. `cd home`
7. `cd ~/data/..`
8. `cd`
9. `cd ..`
10. `cd ../.`

### Relative path resolution {#bash-basics-ex-resolve-rel-path}

Using the filesystem shown in FigureÂ \@ref(fig:bash-basics-ex-rel-path),
if `pwd` displays `/Users/sami`,
what will `ls -F ../backup` display?

1.  `../backup: No such file or directory`
2.  `final original revised`
3.  `final/ original/ revised/`
4.  `data/ analysis/ doc/`

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/bash-basics/exercise-filesystem.png" alt="Filesystem for exercises." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:bash-basics-ex-rel-path)Filesystem for exercises.</p>
</div>

### `ls` reading comprehension {#bash-basics-ex-reading-ls}

Using the filesystem shown in FigureÂ \@ref(fig:bash-basics-ex-rel-path),
if `pwd` displays `/Users/backup`,
and `-r` tells `ls` to display things in reverse order,
what command(s) will result in the following output:

```bash
doc/ data/ analysis/
```

1.  `ls pwd`
2.  `ls -r -F`
3.  `ls -r -F /Users/backup`

### Creating files a different way {#bash-basics-ex-touch}

What happens when you execute `touch my_file.txt`?
(Hint: use `ls -l` to find information about the file)

When might you want to create a file this way?

### Using `rm` safely {#bash-basics-ex-safe-rm}

What would happen if you executed `rm -i my_file.txt`
on the file created in the previous exercise?
Why would we want this protection when using `rm`?

### Moving to the current folder {#bash-basics-ex-move-dot}

After running the following commands,
Amira realizes that she put the (hypothetical) files `chapter1.txt` and `chapter2.txt` into the wrong folder:

```bash
$ ls -F
```
```text
  data/  docs/
```

```bash
$ ls -F data
```
```text
README.md			frankenstein.txt		sherlock_holmes.txt
chapter1.txt		jane_eyre.txt			time_machine.txt
chapter2.txt		moby_dick.txt
dracula.txt			sense_and_sensibility.txt
```

```bash
$ cd docs
```

Fill in the blanks to move these files to the current folder
(i.e., the one she is currently in):

```bash
$ mv ___/chapter1.txt  ___/chapter2.txt ___
```

### Renaming files {#bash-basics-ex-renaming-files}

Suppose that you created a plain-text file in your current directory to contain a list of the
statistical tests you will need to do to analyze your data, and named it: `statstics.txt`

After creating and saving this file you realize you misspelled the filename! You want to
correct the mistake, which of the following commands could you use to do so?

1. `cp statstics.txt statistics.txt`
2. `mv statstics.txt statistics.txt`
3. `mv statstics.txt .`
4. `cp statstics.txt .`

### Moving and copying {#bash-basics-ex-last-ls}

Assuming the following hypothetical files,
what is the output of the closing `ls` command in the sequence shown below?

```bash
$ pwd
```

```text
/Users/amira/data
```

```bash
$ ls
```

```text
books.dat
```

```bash
$ mkdir doc
$ mv books.dat doc/
$ cp doc/books.dat ../books-saved.dat
$ ls
```

1.   `books-saved.dat doc`
2.   `doc`
3.   `books.dat doc`
4.   `books-saved.dat`

### Copy with multiple filenames {#bash-basics-ex-copy-multi}

This exercise explores how `cp` responds when attempting to copy multiple things.

What does `cp` do when given several filenames followed by a directory name?

```bash
$ mkdir backup
$ cp dracula.txt frankenstein.txt backup/
```

What does `cp` do when given three or more filenames?

```bash
$ cp dracula.txt frankenstein.txt jane_eyre.txt
```

### List filenames matching a pattern {#bash-basics-ex-ls-match}

When run in the `data` directory of your project directory, 
which `ls` command(s) will produce this output?

`jane_eyre.txt   sense_and_sensibility.txt`

1. `ls ??n*.txt`
2. `ls *e_*.txt`
3. `ls *n*.txt`
4. `ls *n?e*.txt`

### Organizing directories and files {#bash-basics-ex-organizing}

Amira is working on a project and she sees that her files aren't very well
organized:

```bash
$ ls -F
```

```text
books.txt    data/    results/   titles.txt
```

The `books.txt` and `titles.txt` files contain output from her data
analysis. What command(s) does she need to run
to produce the output shown?

```bash
$ ls -F
```

```text
data/   results/
```

```bash
$ ls results
```

```text
books.txt    titles.txt
```

### Reproduce a directory structure {#bash-basics-ex-reproduce-structure}

You're starting a new analysis, and would like to duplicate the directory
structure from your previous experiment so you can add new data.

Assume that the previous experiment is in a folder called `2016-05-18`,
which contains a `data` folder that in turn contains folders named `raw` and
`processed` that contain data files.  The goal is to copy the folder structure
of `2016-05-18/data` into a folder called `2016-05-20`
so that your final directory structure looks like this:

	2016-05-20/
	âââ data
	    âââ processed
	    âââ raw

Which of the following commands would achieve this objective?
What would the other commands do?

```bash
# Set 1
$ mkdir 2016-05-20
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/processed
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/raw
```

```bash
# Set 2
$ mkdir 2016-05-20
$ cd 2016-05-20
$ mkdir data
$ cd data
$ mkdir raw processed
```

```bash
# Set 3
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/raw
$ mkdir 2016-05-20/data/processed
```

```bash
# Set 4
$ mkdir 2016-05-20
$ cd 2016-05-20
$ mkdir data
$ mkdir raw processed
```

### Wildcard expressions {#bash-basics-ex-wildcard-expressions}

Wildcard expressions can be very complex, but you can sometimes write
them in ways that only use simple syntax, at the expense of being a bit
more verbose.
In your `data/` directory,
the wildcard expression `[st]*.txt`
matches all files beginning with `s` or `t` and ending with `.txt`.
Imagine you forgot about this.

1.  Can you match the same set of files with basic wildcard expressions
    that do not use the `[]` syntax? *Hint*: You may need more than one
    expression.

2.  Under what circumstances would your new expression produce an error message
    where the original one would not?

### Removing unneeded files {#bash-basics-ex-remove-unneeded}

Suppose you want to delete your processed data files, and only keep
your raw files and processing script to save storage.
The raw files end in `.txt` and the processed files end in `.csv`.
Which of the following would remove all the processed data files,
and *only* the processed data files?

1. `rm ?.csv`
2. `rm *.csv`
3. `rm * .csv`
4. `rm *.*`

### Other wildcards {#bash-basics-ex-other-wildcards}

The shell provides several wildcards beyond the widely used `*`.
To explore them,
explain in plain language what (hypothetical) files the expression `novel-????-[ab]*.{txt,pdf}` matches and why.

## Key Points {#bash-basics-keypoints}


-   A \gref{shell}{shell} is a program that reads commands and runs other programs.
-   The \gref{filesystem}{filesystem} manages information stored on disk.
-   Information is stored in files, which are located in directories (folders).
-   Directories can also store other directories, which forms a directory tree.
-   `pwd` prints the user's \gref{current working directory}{current_working_directory}.
-   `/` on its own is the \gref{root directory}{root_directory} of the whole filesystem.
-   `ls` prints a list of files and directories.
-   An \gref{absolute path}{absolute_path} specifies a location from the root of the filesystem.
-   A \gref{relative path}{relative_path} specifies a location in the filesystem starting from the current directory.
-   `cd` changes the current working directory.
-   `..` means the \gref{parent directory}{parent_directory}.
-   `.` on its own means the current directory.
-   `mkdir` creates a new directory.
-   `cp` copies a file.
-   `rm` removes (deletes) a file.
-   `mv` moves (renames) a file or directory.
-   `*` matches zero or more characters in a filename.
-   `?` matches any single character in a filename.
-   `wc` counts lines, words, and characters in its inputs.
-   `man` displays the manual page for a given command; some commands also have a `--help` option.

# Building Tools with the Unix Shell {#bash-tools}

> Wisdom comes from experience. Experience is often a result of lack of wisdom.
>
> --- Terry Pratchett\index{Pratchett, Terry}

The shell's greatest strength is that
it lets us combine programs to create pipelines
that can handle large volumes of data.
This lesson shows how to do that,
and how to repeat commands to process as many files as we want automatically.

We'll be continuing to work in the `zipf` project,
which should contain the following files after the previous chapter:

```text
zipf/
âââ data
    âââ README.md
    âââ dracula.txt
    âââ frankenstein.txt
    âââ jane_eyre.txt
    âââ moby_dick.txt
    âââ sense_and_sensibility.txt
    âââ sherlock_holmes.txt
    âââ time_machine.txt
```

## Combining Commands {#bash-tools-pipe}

To see how the shell lets us combine commands,
let's go into the `zipf/data` directory
and count the number of lines in each file once again:

```bash
$ cd ~/zipf/data
$ wc -l *.txt
```

```text

  15975 dracula.txt
   7832 frankenstein.txt
  21054 jane_eyre.txt
  22331 moby_dick.txt
  13028 sense_and_sensibility.txt
  13053 sherlock_holmes.txt
   3582 time_machine.txt
  96855 total
```

Which of these books is shortest?
We can check by eye when there are only seven files,
but what if there were eight thousand?

Our first step toward a solution is to run this command:

```bash
$ wc -l *.txt > lengths.txt
```

The greater-than symbol `>` tells the shell
to \gref{redirect}{redirection} the command's output to a file instead of printing it.\index{redirection (in Unix shell)}\index{Unix shell!redirection}
Nothing appears on the screen;
instead,
everything that would have appeared has gone into the file `lengths.txt`.
The shell creates this file if it doesn't exist,
or overwrites it if it already exists.

We can print the contents of `lengths.txt` using `cat`,\index{Unix commands!cat}
which is short for con**cat**enate
(because if we give it the names of several files
it will print them all in order):

```bash
$ cat lengths.txt
```

```text
  15975 dracula.txt
   7832 frankenstein.txt
  21054 jane_eyre.txt
  22331 moby_dick.txt
  13028 sense_and_sensibility.txt
  13053 sherlock_holmes.txt
   3582 time_machine.txt
  96855 total
```

We can now use `sort` to sort the lines in this file:

\newpage

```bash
$ sort -n lengths.txt
```

```text
   3582 time_machine.txt
   7832 frankenstein.txt
  13028 sense_and_sensibility.txt
  13053 sherlock_holmes.txt
  15975 dracula.txt
  21054 jane_eyre.txt
  22331 moby_dick.txt
  96855 total

```

Just to be safe,
we use `sort`'s `-n` option to specify that we want to sort numerically.
Without it,
`sort` would order things alphabetically
so that `10` would come before `2`.

`sort` does not change `lengths.txt`.
Instead,
it sends its output to the screen just as `wc` did.
We can therefore put the sorted list of lines in another temporary file called `sorted-lengths.txt`
using `>` once again:

```bash
$ sort -n lengths.txt > sorted-lengths.txt
```

> **Redirecting to the Same File**
>
> It's tempting to send the output of `sort` back to the file it reads:
>
> ```bash
> $ sort -n lengths.txt > lengths.txt
> ```
>
> However, all this does is wipe out the contents of `lengths.txt`.
> The reason is that when the shell sees the redirection,
> it opens the file on the right of the `>` for writing,
> which erases anything that file contained.
> It then runs `sort`, which finds itself reading from a newly empty file.

Creating intermediate files with names like `lengths.txt` and `sorted-lengths.txt` works,
but keeping track of those files and cleaning them up when they're no longer needed is a burden.
Let's delete the two files we just created:

```bash
rm lengths.txt sorted-lengths.txt
```

We can produce the same result more safely and with less typing
using a \gref{pipe}{pipe_shell}:\index{pipe (in Unix shell)}\index{Unix shell!pipe}

```bash
$ wc -l *.txt | sort -n
```

```text
   3582 time_machine.txt
   7832 frankenstein.txt
  13028 sense_and_sensibility.txt
  13053 sherlock_holmes.txt
  15975 dracula.txt
  21054 jane_eyre.txt
  22331 moby_dick.txt
  96855 total
```

The vertical bar `|` between the `wc` and `sort` commands
tells the shell that we want to use the output of the command on the left
as the input to the command on the right.

Running a command with a file as input has a clear flow of information:
the command performs a task on that file and prints the output to the screen
(FigureÂ \@ref(fig:bash-tools-pipe)a).
When using pipes, however,
the information flows differently after the first (upstream) command.
The downstream command doesn't read from a file.
Instead,
it reads the output of the upstream command
(FigureÂ \@ref(fig:bash-tools-pipe)b).

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/bash-tools/pipe.png" alt="Piping commands." width="80%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:bash-tools-pipe)Piping commands.</p>
</div>

We can use `|` to build pipes of any length.
For example,
we can use the command `head` to get just the first three lines of sorted data,\index{Unix commands!head}
which shows us the three shortest books:

```bash
$ wc -l *.txt | sort -n | head -n 3
```

```text
   3582 time_machine.txt
   7832 frankenstein.txt
  13028 sense_and_sensibility.txt
```

> **Options Can Have Values**
>
> When we write `head -n 3`,
> the value 3 is not input to `head`.
> Instead, it is associated with the option `-n`.
> Many options take values like this,
> such as the names of input files or the background color to use in a plot.
> Some versions of `head` may allow you to use `head -3` as a shortcut,
> though this can be confusing if other options are included.

We could always redirect the output to a file
by adding `> shortest.txt` to the end of the pipeline,
thereby retaining our answer for later reference.

In practice,
most Unix users would create this pipeline step by step,
just as we have:
by starting with a single command and adding others one by one,
checking the output after each change.
The shell makes this easy
by letting us move up and down in our \gref{command history}{command_history}
with the <kbd>â</kbd> and <kbd>â</kbd> keys.
We can also edit old commands to create new ones,
so a very common sequence is:

-   Run a command and check its output.
-   Use <kbd>â</kbd> to bring it up again.
-   Add the pipe symbol `|` and another command to the end of the line.
-   Run the pipe and check its output.
-   Use <kbd>â</kbd> to bring it up again.
-   And so on.

## How Pipes Work {#bash-tools-stdio}

In order to use pipes and redirection effectively,
we need to know a little about how they work.
When a computer runs a program---any program---it creates a \gref{process}{process} in memory\index{process}
to hold the program's instructions and data.
Every process in Unix has an input channel called \gref{standard input}{stdin}\index{standard input}\index{stdin}
and an output channel called \gref{standard output}{stdout}.\index{standard output}\index{stdout}
(By now you may be surprised that their names are so memorable,
but don't worry:
most Unix programmers call them "stdin" and "stdout",
which are pronounced "stuh-Din" and "stuh-Dout").

The shell is a program like any other,
and like any other,
it runs inside a process.
Under normal circumstances its standard input is connected to our keyboard
and its standard output to our screen,
so it reads what we type
and displays its output for us to see (FigureÂ \@ref(fig:bash-tools-stdio)a).
When we tell the shell to run a program,
it creates a new process
and temporarily reconnects the keyboard and stream
to that process's standard input and output (FigureÂ \@ref(fig:bash-tools-stdio)b).

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/bash-tools/standard-io.png" alt="Standard I/O." width="80%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:bash-tools-stdio)Standard I/O.</p>
</div>

If we provide one or more files for the command to read,
as with `sort lengths.txt`,
the program reads data from those files.
If we don't provide any filenames,
though,
the Unix convention is for the program to read from standard input.
We can test this by running `sort` on its own,
typing in a few lines of text,
and then pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> to signal the end of input .
`sort` will then sort and print whatever we typed:

```bash
$ sort
one
two
three
four
^D
```

```text
four
one
three
two
```

Redirection with `>` tells the shell to connect the program's standard output to a file
instead of the screen (FigureÂ \@ref(fig:bash-tools-stdio)c).

When we create a pipe like `wc *.txt | sort`,
the shell creates one process for each command so that `wc` and `sort` will run simultaneously,
and then connects the standard output of `wc` directly to the standard input of `sort`
(FigureÂ \@ref(fig:bash-tools-stdio)d).

`wc` doesn't know whether its output is going to the screen,
another program,
or to a file via `>`.
Equally,
`sort` doesn't know if its input is coming from the keyboard or another process;
it just knows that it has to read, sort, and print.

\newpage

Just as we can redirect standard output with `>`,
we can connect standard input to a file using `<`.\index{redirection (in Unix shell)}
In the case of a single file,
this has the same effect as providing the file's name to the command:

```bash
$ wc < moby_dick.txt
```

```text
    22331  215832 1276222
```

If we try to use redirection with a wildcard,
though,
the shell *doesn't* concatenate all of the matching files:

```bash
$ wc < *.txt
```

```text
-bash: *.txt: ambiguous redirect
```

It also doesn't print the error message to standard output,
which we can prove by redirecting:

```bash
$ wc < *.txt > all.txt
```

```text
-bash: *.txt: ambiguous redirect
```

```bash
$ cat all.txt
```

```text
cat: all.txt: No such file or directory
```

Instead,
every process has a second output channel called \gref{standard error}{stderr}
(or \gref{stderr}{stderr}).\index{standard error}\index{stderr}
Programs use it for error messages
so that their attempts to tell us something has gone wrong don't vanish silently into an output file.
There are ways to redirect standard error,
but doing so is almost always a bad idea.

## Repeating Commands on Many Files {#bash-tools-loops}

A loop is a way to repeat a set of commands for each item in a list.\index{loop (in Unix shell)}
We can use them to build complex workflows out of simple pieces,
and (like wildcards)
they reduce the typing we have to do and the number of mistakes we might make.

Let's suppose that we want to take a section out of each book
whose name starts with the letter "s" in the `data` directory.
More specifically,
suppose we want to get the first 8 lines of each book
*after* the 9 lines of license information that appear at the start of the file.
If we only cared about one file,
we could write a pipeline to take the first 17 lines
and then take the last 8 of those:

```bash
$ head -n 17 sense_and_sensibility.txt | tail -n 8
```

```text
Title: Sense and Sensibility

Author: Jane Austen
Editor:
Release Date: May 25, 2008 [EBook #161]
Posting Date:
Last updated: February 11, 2015
Language: English
```

If we try to use a wildcard to select files,
we only get 8 lines of output,
not the 16 we expect:

```bash
$  head -n 17 s*.txt | tail -n 8

The problem is that `head` is producing a single stream of output
containing 17 lines for each file
(along with a header telling us the file's name):

```bash
$ head -n 17 s*.txt
```

As the output shows,
the loop runs our pipeline once for each file.
There is a lot going on here,
so we will break it down into pieces:

1.  The keywords `for`, `in`, `do`, and `done` create the loop,
    and must always appear in that order.

2.  `filename` is a variable just like a variable in Python.\index{variable (in Unix shell)}\index{shell variable}
    At any moment it contains a value,
    but that value can change over time.

3.  The loop runs once for each item in the list.
    Each time it runs,
    it assigns the next item to the variable.
    In this case, `filename` will be `sense_and_sensibility.txt`
    the first time around the loop
    and `sherlock_holmes.txt` the second time.

4.  The commands that the loop executes are called the \gref{body}{loop_body} of the loop\index{loop (in Unix shell)!loop body}
    and appear between the keywords `do` and `done`.
    Those commands use the current value of the variable `filename`,
    but to get it,
    we must put a dollar sign `$` in front of the variable's name.
    If we forget and use `filename` instead of `$filename`,
    the shell will think that we are referring to a file
    that is actually called `filename`.

5.  The shell prompt changes from `$`
    to a \gref{continuation prompt}{continuation_prompt} `>`
    as we type in our loop\index{continuation prompt}\index{prompt (in Unix shell)!continuation}
    to remind us that we haven't finished typing a complete command yet.
    We don't type the `>`,
    just as we don't type the `$`.
    The continuation prompt `>` has nothing to do with redirection;
    it's used because there are only so many punctuation symbols available.

> As mentioned in ChapterÂ \@ref(bash-basics),

It is very common to use a wildcard to select a set of files
and then loop over that set to run commands:

```bash
$ for filename in s*.txt
> do
>   head -n 17 $filename | tail -n 8
> done
```

## Variable Names {#bash-tools-meaningless}

We should always choose meaningful names for variables,
but we should remember that those names don't mean anything to the computer.
For example,
we have called our loop variable `filename`
to make its purpose clear to human readers,
but we could equally well write our loop as:

```bash
$ for x in s*.txt
> do
>   head -n 17 $x | tail -n 8
> done
```

or as:

```bash
$ for username in s*.txt
> do
>   head -n 17 $username | tail -n 8
> done
```

*Don't do this.*
Programs are only useful if people can understand them,
so meaningless names like `x` and misleading names like `username`
increase the odds of misunderstanding.

## Redoing Things {#bash-tools-history}

Loops are useful if we know in advance what we want to repeat,
but we can also repeat commands that we have run recently.
One way is to use <kbd>â</kbd> and <kbd>â</kbd>
to go up and down in our command history as described earlier.
Another is to use `history`\index{history (in Unix shell)}\index{Unix commands!history}
to get a list of the last few hundred commands we have run:

```bash
$ history
```

```text
  551  wc -l *.txt | sort -n
  552  wc -l *.txt | sort -n | head -n 3
  553  wc -l *.txt | sort -n | head -n 1 > shortest.txt
```

We can use an exclamation mark `!` followed by a number
to repeat a recent command:

```bash
$ !552
```

```bash
wc -l *.txt | sort -n | head -n 3
```

```text
   3582 time_machine.txt
   7832 frankenstein.txt
  13028 sense_and_sensibility.txt
```

The shell prints the command it is going to re-run to standard error
before executing it,
so that (for example) `!572Â >Â results.txt`
puts the command's output in a file
*without* also writing the command to the file.

Having an accurate record of the things we have done
and a simple way to repeat them
are two of the main reasons people use the Unix shell.
In fact,
being able to repeat history is such a powerful idea
that the shell gives us several ways to do it:

-   `!head` re-runs the most recent command starting with `head`,
    while `!wc` re-runs the most recent starting with `wc`.
-   If we type <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> (for **r**everse search)
    the shell searches backward through its history for whatever we type next.
    If we don't like the first thing it finds,
    we can type <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> again to go further back.

If we use `history`, <kbd>â</kbd>, or <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd>
we will quickly notice that loops don't have to be broken across lines.
Instead,
their parts can be separated with semi-colons:

```bash
$ for filename in s*.txt; do head -n 17 $filename | tail -n 8;
done
```

This is fairly readable,
though it becomes more challenging if our for loop includes multiple commands.
For example,
we may choose to include the `echo` command,
which prints its arguments to the screen,
so we can keep track of progress or for debugging.
Compare this:

```bash
$ for filename in s*.txt
> do
>   echo $filename
>   head -n 17 $filename | tail -n 8
> done
```

with this:

```bash
$ for filename in s*.txt; do echo $filename; head -n 17 $filename
  | tail -n 8; done
```

Even experienced users have a tendency to (incorrectly) 
put the semi-colon after `do` instead of before it.
If our loop contains multiple commands,
though,
the multi-line format is much easier to read and troubleshoot.
Note that (depending on the size of your shell window)
the format separated by semi-colons may be printed onto more than one line,
as shown in the previous code example.
You can tell whether code entered into your shell 
is intended to be run as a single line based on the prompt:
both the original command prompt (`$`) and the continuation prompt (`>`) 
indicate the code is on separate lines;
the absence of either in shell commands indicates it is a single line of code.

## Creating New Filenames Automatically {#bash-tools-autoname}

Suppose we want to create a backup copy of each book whose name ends in "e".
If we don't want to change the files' names,
we can do this with `cp`:

```bash
$ cd ~/zipf
$ mkdir backup
$ cp data/*e.txt backup
$ ls backup
```

```text
jane_eyre.txt  time_machine.txt
```

> **Warnings**
>
> If you attempt to re-execute the code chunk above,
> you'll end up with an error after the second line:
>
> ```text
> mkdir: backup: File exists
> ```
>
> This warning isn't necessarily a cause for alarm.
> It lets you know that the command couldn't be completed,
> but will not prevent you from proceeding.

But what if we want to append the extension `.bak` to the files' names?
`cp` can do this for a single file:

```bash
$ cp data/time_machine.txt backup/time_machine.txt.bak
```

but not for all the files at once:

```bash
$ cp data/*e.txt backup/*e.txt.bak
```

```text
cp: target 'backup/*e.txt.bak' is not a directory
```

`backup/*e.txt.bak` doesn't match anything---those files don't yet exist---so
after the shell expands the `*` wildcards,
what we are actually asking `cp` to do is:

```bash
$ cp data/jane_eyre.txt data/time_machine.txt backup/*e.bak
```

This doesn't work because `cp` only understands how to do two things:
copy a single file to create another file,
or copy a bunch of files into a directory.
If we give it more than two names as arguments,
it expects the last one to be a directory.
Since `backup/*e.bak` is not,
`cp` reports an error.

Instead,
let's use a loop to copy files to the backup directory
and append the `.bak` suffix:

```bash
$ cd data
$ for filename in *e.txt
> do
>   cp $filename ../backup/$filename.bak
> done
$ ls ../backup
```

```text
jane_eyre.txt.bak  time_machine.txt.bak
```

## Summary {#bash-tools-summary}

The shell's greatest strength is the way it combines a few powerful ideas with pipes and loops.
The next chapter will show how we can make our work more reproducible
by saving commands in files that we can run over and over again.

## Exercises {#bash-tools-exercises}

The exercises below involve creating and moving new files,
as well as considering hypothetical files.
Please note that if you create or move any files or directories in your Zipf's Law project,
you may want to reorganize your files following the outline at the beginning of the next chapter.
If you accidentally delete necessary files,
you can start with a fresh copy of the data files
by following the instructions in SectionÂ \@ref(getting-started-download-data).

### What does `>>` mean? {#bash-tools-ex-redirect-append}

We have seen the use of `>`, but there is a similar operator `>>` which works slightly differently.
We'll learn about the differences between these two operators by printing some strings.
We can use the `echo` command to print strings as shown below:

\newpage

```bash
$ echo The echo command prints text
```

```text
The echo command prints text
```

Now test the commands below to reveal the difference between the two operators:

```bash
$ echo hello > testfile01.txt
```

and:

```bash
$ echo hello >> testfile02.txt
```

Hint: Try executing each command twice in a row and then examining the output files.

### Appending data {#bash-tools-ex-append-data}

Given the following commands,
what will be included in the file `extracted.txt`:

```bash
$ head -n 3 dracula.txt > extracted.txt
$ tail -n 2 dracula.txt >> extracted.txt
```

1. The first three lines of `dracula.txt`
2. The last two lines of `dracula.txt`
3. The first three lines and the last two lines of `dracula.txt`
4. The second and third lines of `dracula.txt`

### Piping commands {#bash-tools-ex-piping}

In our current directory, we want to find the 3 files which have the least number of
lines. Which command listed below would work?

1. `wc -l * > sort -n > head -n 3`
2. `wc -l * | sort -n | head -n 1-3`
3. `wc -l * | head -n 3 | sort -n`
4. `wc -l * | sort -n | head -n 3`

### Why does `uniq` only remove adjacent duplicates? {#bash-tools-ex-uniq-adjacent}

The command `uniq` removes adjacent duplicated lines from its input.
Consider a hypothetical file `genres.txt` containing the following data:

```text
science fiction
fantasy
science fiction
fantasy
science fiction
science fiction
```

Running the command `uniq genres.txt` produces:

```text
science fiction
fantasy
science fiction
fantasy
science fiction
```

Why do you think `uniq` only removes *adjacent* duplicated lines?
(Hint: think about very large datasets.) What other command could
you combine with it in a pipe to remove all duplicated lines?

### Pipe reading comprehension {#bash-tools-ex-reading-pipes}

A file called `titles.txt` contains a list of book titles and publication years:

```text
Dracula,1897
Frankenstein,1818
Jane Eyre,1847
Moby Dick,1851
Sense and Sensibility,1811
The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,1892
The Invisible Man,1897
The Time Machine,1895
Wuthering Heights,1847
```

What text passes through each of the pipes and the final redirect in the pipeline below?

```bash
$ cat titles.txt | head -n 5 | tail -n 3 | sort -r > final.txt
```

Hint: build the pipeline up one command at a time to test your understanding

### Pipe construction {#bash-tools-ex-pipe-construction}

For the file `titles.txt` from the previous exercise, consider the following command:

```bash
$ cut -d , -f 2 titles.txt
```

What does the `cut` command (and its options) accomplish?

### Which pipe? {#bash-tools-ex-which-pipe}

Consider the same `titles.txt` from the previous exercises.

The `uniq` command has a `-c` option which gives a count of the
number of times a line occurs in its input.
If `titles.txt` was in your working directory,
what command would you use to produce
a table that shows the total count of each publication year in the file?

1.  `sort titles.txt | uniq -c`
2.  `sort -t, -k2,2 titles.txt | uniq -c`
3.  `cut -d, -f 2 titles.txt | uniq -c`
4.  `cut -d, -f 2 titles.txt | sort | uniq -c`
5.  `cut -d, -f 2 titles.txt | sort | uniq -c | wc -l`

### Doing a dry run {#bash-tools-ex-loop-dry-run}

A loop is a way to do many things at once---or to make many mistakes at
once if it does the wrong thing. One way to check what a loop *would* do
is to `echo` the commands it would run instead of actually running them.

Suppose we want to preview the commands the following loop will execute
without actually running those commands
(`analyze` is a hypothetical command):

```bash
$ for file in *.txt
> do
>   analyze $file > analyzed-$file
> done
```

What is the difference between the two loops below,
and which one would we want to run?

```bash
$ for file in *.txt
> do
>   echo analyze $file > analyzed-$file
> done
```

or:

```bash
$ for file in *.txt
> do
>   echo "analyze $file > analyzed-$file"
> done
```

### Variables in loops {#bash-tools-ex-loop-variables}

Given the files in `data/`,
what is the output of the following code?

```bash
$ for datafile in *.txt
> do
>    ls *.txt
> done
```

Now, what is the output of the following code?

```bash
$ for datafile in *.txt
> do
>	ls $datafile
> done
```

Why do these two loops give different outputs?

### Limiting sets of files {#bash-tools-ex-limiting-file-sets}

What would be the output of running the following loop in your `data/` directory?

```bash
$ for filename in d*
> do
>    ls $filename
> done
```

How would the output differ from using this command instead?

```bash
$ for filename in *d*
> do
>    ls $filename
> done
```

### Saving to a file in a loop {#bash-tools-ex-loop-save}

Consider running the following loop in the  `data/` directory:

```bash
for book in *.txt
> do
>     echo $book
>     head -n 16 $book > headers.txt
> done
```

Why would the following loop be preferable?

```bash
for book in *.txt
> do
>     head -n 16 $book >> headers.txt
> done
```

\newpage

### Why does `history` record commands before running them? {#bash-tools-ex-history-order}

If you run the command:

```bash
$ history | tail -n 5 > recent.sh
```

the last command in the file is the `history` command itself, i.e.,
the shell has added `history` to the command log before actually
running it. In fact, the shell *always* adds commands to the log
before running them. Why do you think it does this?

## Key Points {#bash-tools-keypoints}


-   `cat` displays the contents of its inputs.
-   `head` displays the first few lines of its input.
-   `tail` displays the last few lines of its input.
-   `sort` sorts its inputs.
-   Use the up-arrow key to scroll up through previous commands to edit and repeat them.
-   Use `history` to display recent commands and `!number` to repeat a command by number.
-   Every process in Unix has an input channel called \gref{standard input}{stdin}
    and an output channel called \gref{standard output}{stdin}.
-   `>` redirects a command's output to a file, overwriting any existing content.
-   `>>` appends a command's output to a file.
-   `<` operator redirects input to a command.
-   A \gref{pipe}{pipe_shell} `|` sends the output of the command on the left to the input of the command on the right.
-   A `for` loop repeats commands once for every thing in a list.
-   Every `for` loop  must have a variable to refer to the thing it is currently operating on
    and a \gref{body}{loop_body} containing commands to execute.
-   Use `$name` or `${name}` to get the value of a variable.

The previous chapters explained how we can use the command line
to do all of the things we can do with a GUI,
and how to combine commands in new ways using pipes and redirection.
This chapter extends those ideas to show
how we can create new tools by saving commands in files
and how to use a more powerful version of \gref{wildcards}{wildcard}\index{regular expression!relation to wildcard}
to extract data from files.

We'll be continuing to work in the `zipf` project,
which after the previous chapter should contain the following files:

```text

```

> **Deleting Extra Files**
>
> You may have additional files
> if you worked through all of the exercises in the previous chapter.
> Feel free to delete them or move them to a separate directory.
> If you have accidentally deleted files you need,
> you can download them again by following the instructions in SectionÂ \@ref(getting-started-download-data).

## Creating New Commands {#bash-advanced-script}

Loops let us run the same commands many times,
but we can go further and save commands in files
so that we can repeat complex operations with a few keystrokes.
For historical reasons,
a file full of shell commands is usually called a \gref{shell script}{shell_script},\index{shell script}
but it is really just another kind of program.

Let's start by creating a new directory for our runnable programs called `bin/`,
consistent with the project structure described in SectionÂ \@ref(getting-started-organize).

```bash
$ cd ~/zipf
$ mkdir bin
$ cd bin
```

Edit a new file called `book_summary.sh` to hold our shell script:

```bash
$ nano book_summary.sh
```

and insert this line:

```text
head -n 17 ../data/moby_dick.txt | tail -n 8
```

Note that we do *not* put the `$` prompt at the front of the line.
We have been showing that to highlight interactive commands,
but in this case we are putting the command in a file rather than running it immediately.

> **Empty Line at the End of a File?**
> 
> You'll often see scripts from many languages that end in an empty line.
> What you are seeing, though,
> is the last line of code ending in a newline character.
> This indicates to the computer that the code has ended. 
> While this newline character is not *required* for shell scripts to work,
> and sometimes isn't shown by coding tools,
> it does make it easier to view and modify scripts.
> When you are copying code from this book,
> remember to add an empty line at the end!\index{whitespace}

Once we have added this line,
we can save the file with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>O</kbd>
and exit with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>.
`ls` shows that our file now exists:

```bash
$ ls
```

```text
book_summary.sh
```

We can check the contents of the file using `cat book_summary.sh`.
More importantly,
we can now ask the shell to run this file:

```bash
$ bash book_summary.sh
```

```text
Title: Moby Dick
       or The Whale
Author: Herman Melville
Editor:
Release Date: December 25, 2008 [EBook #2701]
Posting Date:
Last Updated: December 3, 2017
Language: English
```

Sure enough,
our script's output is exactly the same text we would get if we ran the command directly.
If we want,
we can pipe the output of our shell script to another command to count how many lines it contains:

```bash
$ bash book_summary.sh | wc -l
```

```text
     8
```

What if we want our script to print the name of the book's author?
The command `grep`\index{grep}\index{Unix commands!grep} finds and prints lines that match a pattern.
We'll learn more about `grep` in SectionÂ \@ref(bash-advanced-grep),
but for now we can edit the script:

```bash
$ nano book_summary.sh
```

and add a search for the word "Author":

```text
head -n 17 ../data/moby_dick.txt | tail -n 8 | grep Author
```

Sure enough,
when we run our modified script:

```bash
$ bash book_summary.sh
```

we get the line we want:

```text
Author: Herman Melville
```

And once again
we can pipe the output of our script into other commands
just as we would pipe the output from any other program.
Here,
we count the number of words in the author line:

```bash
$ bash book_summary.sh | wc -w
```

```text
      3
```

## Making Scripts More Versatile {#bash-advanced-params}

Getting the name of the author for only one of the books isn't particularly useful.
What we really want is a way to get the name of the author from any of our files.
Let's edit `book_summary.sh` again
and replace `../data/moby_dick.txt` with
a special variable `$1`.\index{shell script!arguments}\index{\$1, \$2, etc. (in shell script)}\index{arguments (of shell script)}
Once our change is made,
`book_summary.sh` should contain:

```text
head -n 17 $1 | tail -n 8 | grep Author
```

Inside a shell script,
`$1` means "the first argument on the command line."
If we now run our script like this:

```bash
$ bash book_summary.sh ../data/moby_dick.txt
```

then `$1` is assigned `../data/moby_dick.txt`
and we get exactly the same output as before.
If we give the script a different filename:

```bash
$  bash book_summary.sh ../data/frankenstein.txt
```

we get the name of the author of that book instead:

```text
Author: Mary Wollstonecraft (Godwin) Shelley
```

Our small script is now doing something useful,
but it may take the next person who reads it a moment to figure out exactly what.
We can improve our script by adding \gref{comments}{comment} at the top:\index{comments!in shell script}

```text
# Get author information from a Project Gutenberg eBook.
# Usage: bash book_summary.sh /path/to/file.txt
head -n 17 $1 | tail -n 8 | grep Author
```

As in Python,
a comment starts with a `#` character and runs to the end of the line.
The computer ignores comments,
but they help people (including our future self) understand and use what we've created.

Let's make one more change to our script.
Instead of always extracting the author name,
let's have it select whatever information the user specified:

```text
# Get desired information from a Project Gutenberg eBook.
# Usage: bash book_summary.sh /path/to/file.txt what_to_look_for
head -n 17 $1 | tail -n 8 | grep $2
```

The change is very small:
we have replaced the fixed string 'Author' with a reference to the special variable `$2`,
which is assigned the value of the second command-line argument we give the script when we run it.

> **Update Your Comments**
>
> As you update the code in your script,
> don't forget to update the comments that describe the code.
> A description that sends readers in the wrong direction is worse than none at all,
> so do your best to avoid this common oversight.

Let's check that it works by asking for *Frankenstein*'s release date:

```bash
$ bash book_summary.sh ../data/frankenstein.txt Release
```

```text
Release Date: June 17, 2008 [EBook #84]

## Turning Interactive Work into a Script {#bash-advanced-capture}

Suppose we have just run a series of commands that did something useful,
such as summarizing all books in a given directory:

```bash
$ for x in ../data/*.txt
> do
>   echo $x
>   bash book_summary.sh $x Author
> done > authors.txt
$ for x in ../data/*.txt
> do
>   echo $x
>   bash book_summary.sh $x Release
> done > releases.txt
$ ls
```
```text
authors.txt        book_summary.sh      releases.txt
```
```bash
$ mkdir ../results
$ mv authors.txt releases.txt ../results
```

Instead of typing those commands into a file in an editor
(and potentially getting them wrong)
we can use `history` and redirection to save recent commands to a file.\index{shell script!using history to create}
For example,
we can save the last six commands to `summarize_all_books.sh`:

```bash
$ history 6 > summarize_all_books.sh
$ cat summarize_all_books.sh
```

```text
297 for x in ../data/*.txt; do echo $x;
  bash book_summary.sh $x Author; done > authors.txt
298 for x in ../data/*.txt; do echo $x;
  bash book_summary.sh $x Release; done > releases.txt
299 ls
300 mkdir ../results
301 mv authors.txt releases.txt ../results
302 history 6 > summarize_all_books.sh
```

We can now open the file in an editor,
remove the serial numbers at the start of each line,
and delete the lines we don't want
to create a script that captures exactly what we actually did.
This is how we usually develop shell scripts:
run commands interactively a few times to make sure they are doing the right thing,
then save our recent history to a file and turn that into a reusable script.

## Finding Things in Files {#bash-advanced-grep}

We can use `head` and `tail` to select lines from a file by position,
but we also often want to select lines that contain certain values.
This is called \gref{filtering}{filter},\index{filter (in Unix shell)}
and we usually do it in the shell with the command `grep`\index{grep}\index{Unix commands!grep}
that we briefly met in SectionÂ \@ref(bash-advanced-script).
Its name is an acronym of "global regular expression print,"
which was a common sequence of operations in early Unix text editors.

To show how `grep` works,
we will use our sleuthing skills to explore `data/sherlock_holmes.txt`.
First,
let's find lines that contain the word "Sherlock".
Since there are likely to be hundreds of matches,
we will pipe `grep`'s output to `head` to show only the first few:

```bash
$ cd ~/zipf
$ grep Sherlock data/sherlock_holmes.txt | head -n 5
```

Here, `Sherlock` is our (very simple) pattern.
`grep` searches the file line by line
and shows those lines that contain matches,
so the output is:

```text
Project Gutenberg's The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, by Arthur
Conan Doyle
Title: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes
To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard
as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes' succinct description,
"Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes."
```

If we run `grep sherlock` instead, we get no output
because `grep` patterns are case-sensitive.
If we wanted to make the search case-insensitive,
we can add the option `-i`:

```bash
$ grep -i sherlock data/sherlock_holmes.txt | head -n 5
```

```text
Project Gutenberg's The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, by Arthur
Conan Doyle
Title: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes
*** START OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE ADVENTURES OF
SHERLOCK HOLMES ***
THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES
To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard
```

This output is different from our previous output
because of the lines containing "SHERLOCK" near the top of the file.

Next, let's search for the pattern `on`:

```bash
$ grep on data/sherlock_holmes.txt | head -n 5
```

```text
Project Gutenberg's The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, by Arthur
Conan Doyle
This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away
or with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net
Author: Arthur Conan Doyle
```

In each of these lines,
our pattern ("on") is part of a larger word such as "Conan".
To restrict matching to lines containing `on` by itself,
we can give `grep` the `-w` option (for "match words"):

```bash
$ grep -w on data/sherlock_holmes.txt | head -n 5
```

```text

that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful
"It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me that on the
on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted
```

\newpage

What if we want to search for a phrase rather than a single word?

```bash
$ grep on the data/sherlock_holmes.txt | head -n 5
```

```text
grep: the: No such file or directory
data/sherlock_holmes.txt:Project Gutenberg's The Adventures of
  Sherlock Holmes, by Arthur Conan Doyle
data/sherlock_holmes.txt:This eBook is for the use of anyone

  You may copy it, give it away or
data/sherlock_holmes.txt:with this eBook or online at
  www.gutenberg.net
data/sherlock_holmes.txt:Author: Arthur Conan Doyle
```

In this case,
`grep` uses `on` as the pattern
and tries to find it in files called `the` and `data/sherlock_holmes.txt`.
It then tells us that the file `the` cannot be found,
but prints `data/sherlock_holmes.txt` as a prefix to each other line of output
to tell us which file those lines came from.
If we want to give `grep` both words as a single argument,
we must wrap them in quotation marks as before:

```bash
$ grep "on the" data/sherlock_holmes.txt | head -n 5
```

```text
One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was

```

One of the most useful options for `grep` is `-n`,
which numbers the lines that match the search:

```bash
$ grep -n "on the" data/sherlock_holmes.txt | head -n 5
```

```text
105:One night--it was on the twentieth of March, 1888--I was
118:drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new
155:"It is simplicity itself," said he; "my eyes tell me ...
165:on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has ...
198:pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon ...
```

`grep` has many options---so many,
in fact,
that almost every letter of the alphabet means something to it:

```bash
$ man grep
```

```text
GREP(1)           BSD General Commands Manual         GREP(1)

NAME
     grep, egrep, fgrep, zgrep, zegrep, zfgrep -- file pattern
      searcher

SYNOPSIS
     grep [-abcdDEFGHhIiJLlmnOopqRSsUVvwxZ] [-A num] [-B num]
          [-C[num]] [-e pattern] [-f file] [--binary-files=value]
          [--color[=when]] [--colour[=when]] [--context[=num]]
          [--label] [--line-buffered]
          [--null] [pattern] [file ...]
...more...
```

We can combine options to `grep` as we do with other Unix commands.
For example,
we can combine two options we've covered previously with `-v`
to invert the match---i.e.,
to print lines that *don't* match the pattern:

```bash
$ grep -i -n -v the data/sherlock_holmes.txt | head -n 5
```

```text
2:
4:almost no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give ...
6:with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net
7:
8:
```

As we learned in SectionÂ \@ref(bash-basics-navigate),
we can write this command as `grep -inv`,
but probably shouldn't for the sake of readability.

If we want to search several files at once,
all we have to do is give `grep` all of their names.
The easiest way to do this is usually to use wildcards.
For example,
this command counts how many lines contain "pain" in all of our books:

```bash
$ grep -w pain data/*.txt | wc -l
```

```text
     122
```

Alternatively,
the `-r` option (for "recursive") tells `grep` to search all of the files
in or below a directory:

```bash
$ grep -w -r pain data | wc -l
```

```text
     122
```

`grep` becomes even more powerful
when we start using \gref{regular expressions}{regular_expression},\index{regular expression}
which are sets of letters, numbers, and symbols that define complex patterns.
For example,
this command finds lines that start with the letter 'T':

```bash
$ grep -E "^T" data/sherlock_holmes.txt | head -n 5
```

```text
This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
Title: The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes
THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES
To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard
The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen
```

The `-E` option tells `grep` to interpret the pattern as a regular expression,
rather than searching for an actual circumflex followed by an upper-case 'T'.
The quotation marks prevent the shell from treating special characters in the pattern as wildcards,
and the `^` means that a line only matches
if it begins with the search term---in this case, `T`.

Many tools support regular expressions:
we can use them in programming languages,
database queries,
online search engines,
and most text editors (though not Nano---its creators wanted to keep it as small as possible).
A detailed guide of regular expressions is outside the scope of this book,
but a wide range of tutorials are available online,
and @Goyv2012 is a useful companion if you need to go further.

## Finding Files {#bash-advanced-find}

While `grep` finds things in files,
the `find` command finds files themselves.\index{find}\index{Unix commands!find}
It also has a lot of options,
but unlike most Unix commands they are written as full words
rather than single-letter abbreviations.
To show how it works,
we will use the entire contents of our `zipf` directory,
including files we created earlier in this chapter:

```text
zipf/
âââ bin
âÂ Â  âââ book_summary.sh
âÂ Â  âââ summarize_all_books.sh
âââ data
âÂ Â  âââ README.md
âÂ Â  âââ dracula.txt
âÂ Â  âââ frankenstein.txt
âÂ Â  âââ jane_eyre.txt
âÂ Â  âââ moby_dick.txt
âÂ Â  âââ sense_and_sensibility.txt
âÂ Â  âââ sherlock_holmes.txt
âÂ Â  âââ time_machine.txt
âââ results
 Â Â  âââ authors.txt
 Â Â  âââ releases.txt
```

For our first command,
let's run `find .` to find and list everything in this directory.
As always,
`.` on its own means the current working directory,
which is where we want our search to start.

```bash
$ cd ~/zipf
$ find .
```

```text
.
./bin
./bin/summarize_all_books.sh
./bin/book_summary.sh
./results
./results/releases.txt
./results/authors.txt
./data
./data/moby_dick.txt
./data/sense_and_sensibility.txt
./data/sherlock_holmes.txt
./data/time_machine.txt
./data/frankenstein.txt
./data/README.md
./data/dracula.txt
./data/jane_eyre.txt
```

If we only want to find directories,
we can tell `find` to show us things of type `d`:

```bash
$ find . -type d
```

```text
.
./bin
./results
./data
```

If we change `-type d` to `-type f`
we get a listing of all the files instead:

```bash
$ find . -type f
```

```text
./bin/summarize_all_books.sh
./bin/book_summary.sh
./results/releases.txt
./results/authors.txt
./data/moby_dick.txt
./data/sense_and_sensibility.txt
./data/sherlock_holmes.txt
./data/time_machine.txt
./data/frankenstein.txt
./data/README.md
./data/dracula.txt
./data/jane_eyre.txt
```

Now let's try matching by name:

```bash
$ find . -name "*.txt"
```

```text
./results/releases.txt
./results/authors.txt
./data/moby_dick.txt
./data/sense_and_sensibility.txt
./data/sherlock_holmes.txt
./data/time_machine.txt
./data/frankenstein.txt
./data/dracula.txt
./data/jane_eyre.txt
```

Notice the quotes around `"*.txt"`.
If we omit them and type:

```bash
$ find . -name *.txt
```

then the shell tries to expand the `*` wildcard in `*.txt`
*before* running `find`.
Since there aren't any text files in the current directory,
the expanded list is empty,
so the shell tries to run the equivalent of

```bash
$ find . -name
```

and gives us the error message:

```text
find: -name: requires additional arguments
```

We have seen before how to combine commands using pipes.
Let's use another technique to see how large our books are:

```bash
$ wc -l $(find . -name "*.txt")
```

```text
14 ./results/releases.txt
14 ./results/authors.txt
22331 ./data/moby_dick.txt
13028 ./data/sense_and_sensibility.txt
13053 ./data/sherlock_holmes.txt
3582 ./data/time_machine.txt
7832 ./data/frankenstein.txt
15975 ./data/dracula.txt
21054 ./data/jane_eyre.txt
96883 total
```

When the shell executes our command,
it runs whatever is inside `$(...)`\index{Unix shell!command expansion}\index{command expansion (in Unix shell)}\index{\$(...) in Unix shell}
and then replaces `$(...)` with that command's output.
Since the output of `find` is the paths to our text files,
the shell constructs the command:

```bash
$ wc -l ./results/releases.txt ... ./data/jane_eyre.txt
```

(We are using `...` in place of seven files' names in order to fit things neatly on the printed page.)
This results in the output as seen above.
It is exactly like expanding the wildcard in `*.txt`,
but more flexible.

We will often use `find` and `grep` together.
The first command finds files whose names match a pattern,
while the second looks for lines inside those files that match another pattern.
For example,
we can look for `Authors` in all our text files:

```bash
$ grep "Author:" $(find . -name "*.txt")
```

```text
./results/authors.txt:Author: Bram Stoker
./results/authors.txt:Author: Mary Wollstonecraft (Godwin)
Shelley
./results/authors.txt:Author: Charlotte Bronte
./results/authors.txt:Author: Herman Melville
./results/authors.txt:Author: Jane Austen
./results/authors.txt:Author: Arthur Conan Doyle
./results/authors.txt:Author: H. G. Wells
./data/moby_dick.txt:Author: Herman Melville
./data/sense_and_sensibility.txt:Author: Jane Austen
./data/sherlock_holmes.txt:Author: Arthur Conan Doyle
./data/time_machine.txt:Author: H. G. Wells
./data/frankenstein.txt:Author: Mary Wollstonecraft (Godwin)
Shelley
./data/dracula.txt:Author: Bram Stoker
./data/jane_eyre.txt:Author: Charlotte Bronte
```

We can also use `$(...)` expansion to create a list of filenames to use in a loop:\index{loop (in Unix shell)!using command expansion}

```bash
$ for file in $(find . -name "*.txt")
> do
> cp $file $file.bak
> done
$ find . -name "*.bak"
```

```text
./results/releases.txt.bak
./results/authors.txt.bak
./data/frankenstein.txt.bak
./data/sense_and_sensibility.txt.bak
./data/dracula.txt.bak
./data/time_machine.txt.bak
./data/moby_dick.txt.bak
./data/jane_eyre.txt.bak
./data/sherlock_holmes.txt.bak
```

## Configuring the Shell {#bash-advanced-vars}

As SectionÂ \@ref(bash-tools-loops) explained,
the shell is a program,
and it has variables like any other program.
Some of those variables control the shell's operations;
by changing their values
we can change how the shell and other programs behave.

Let's run the command `set`\index{set (in Unix shell)}\index{Unix commands!set}
and look at some of the variables the shell defines:

```bash
$ set
```

```text
COMPUTERNAME=TURING
HOME=/Users/amira
HOMEDRIVE=C:
HOSTNAME=TURING
HOSTTYPE=i686
NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS=4
OS=Windows_NT
PATH=/Users/amira/anaconda3/bin:/usr/bin:
  /bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/usr/local/bin
PWD=/Users/amira
UID=1000
USERNAME=amira
...
```

There are many more than are shown here---roughly a hundred
in our current shell session.
And yes,
using `set` to *show* things might seem a little strange,
even for Unix,
but if we don't give it any arguments,
the command might as well show us things we *could* set.

By convention,
\gref{shell variables}{shell_variable}\index{variable (in Unix shell)}\index{shell variable} that are always present have upper-case names.
All shell variables' values are strings,
even those (such as `UID`) that look like numbers.
It's up to programs to convert these strings to other types when necessary.
For example,
if a program wanted to find out how many processors the computer had,
it would convert the value of `NUMBER_OF_PROCESSORS` from a string to an integer.

Similarly, some variables (like `PATH`) store lists of values.\index{PATH variable (in Unix shell)}\index{Unix shell!PATH variable}
In this case, the convention is to use a colon ':' as a separator.
If a program wants the individual elements of such a list,
it must split the variable's value into pieces.

Let's have a closer look at `PATH`.
Its value defines the shell's \gref{search path}{search_path},
which is the list of directories that the shell looks in for programs
when we type in a command name without specifying exactly where it is.
For example,
when we type a command like `analyze`,
the shell needs to decide whether to run `./analyze` (in our current directory)
or `/bin/analyze` (in a system directory).
To do this,
the shell checks each directory in the `PATH` variable in turn.
As soon as it finds a program with the right name,
it stops searching and runs what it has found.

To show how this works,
here are the components of `PATH` listed one per line:

```bash
/Users/amira/anaconda3/bin
/usr/bin
/bin
/usr/sbin
/sbin
/usr/local/bin
```

Suppose that our computer has three programs called `analyze`:
`/bin/analyze`,
`/usr/local/bin/analyze`,
and `/Users/amira/analyze`.
Since the shell searches the directories in the order in which they're listed in `PATH`,
it finds `/bin/analyze` first and runs that.
Since `/Users/amira` is not in our path,
Bash will *never* find the program `/Users/amira/analyze`
unless we type the path in explicitly
(for example,
as `./analyze` if we are in `/Users/amira`).

If we want to see a variable's value,
we can print it using the `echo` command
introduced at the end of SectionÂ \@ref(bash-tools-history).
Let's look at the value of the variable `HOME`,\index{HOME variable (in Unix shell)}\index{Unix shell!HOME variable}
which keeps track of our home directory:

```bash
$ echo HOME
```

```text
HOME
```

Whoops: this just prints "HOME", which isn't what we wanted.
Instead,
we need to run this:

```bash
$ echo $HOME
```

```text
/Users/amira
```

\newpage

As with loop variables (SectionÂ \@ref(bash-tools-loops)),
the dollar sign before the variable names tells the shell
that we want the variable's value.
This works just like wildcard expansion---the shell replaces
the variable's name with its value *before* running the command we've asked for.
Thus,
`echo $HOME` becomes `echo /Users/amira`,
which displays the right thing.

Creating a variable is easy:\index{shell variable!creating}
we assign a value to a name using "=",
putting quotes around the value if it contains spaces or special characters:

```bash
$ DEPARTMENT="Library Science"
$ echo $DEPARTMENT
```

```text
Library Science
```

To change the value, we simply assign a new one:

```bash
$ DEPARTMENT="Information Science"
$ echo $DEPARTMENT
```

```text
Information Science
```

If we want to set some variables automatically every time we run a shell,
we can put commands to do this in a file called `.bashrc` in our home directory.\index{.bashrc file (in Unix shell)}\index{Unix shell!.bashrc file}
For example,
here are two lines in `/Users/amira/.bashrc`:

```text
export DEPARTMENT="Library Science"
export TEMP_DIR=/tmp
export BACKUP_DIR=$TEMP_DIR/backup
```

These three lines create the variables `DEPARTMENT`,
`TEMP_DIR`,
and `BACKUP_DIR`,
and \gref{export}{export_variable}\index{shell variable!exporting} them so that any programs the shell runs can see them as well.
Notice that `BACKUP_DIR`'s definition relies on the value of `TEMP_DIR`,
so that if we change where we put temporary files,
our backups will be relocated automatically.
However,
this will only happen once we restart the shell,
because `.bashrc` is only executed when the shell starts up.

>
> The '.' character at the front of the name `.bashrc`
> prevents `ls` from listing this file
> unless we specifically ask it to using `-a`.
> The "rc" at the end is an abbreviation for "run commands",

> and is now just a convention everyone follows without understanding why.

While we're here,
it's also common to use the `alias` command\index{Unix commands!alias}\index{alias (Unix command)}
to create shortcuts for things we frequently type.
For example,
we can define the alias `backup`
to run `/bin/zback` with a specific set of arguments:

```bash
alias backup=/bin/zback -v --nostir -R 20000 $HOME $BACKUP_DIR
```

Aliases can save us a lot of typing, and hence a lot of typing mistakes.
The name of an alias can be the same as an existing command,
so we can use them to change the behavior of a familiar command:

```bash
# Long list format including hidden files
alias ls='ls -la'

# Print the file paths that were copied/moved
alias mv='mv -v'
alias cp='cp -v'

# Request confirmation to remove a file and
# print the file path that is removed
alias rm='rm -iv'
```

We can find interesting suggestions for other aliases
by searching online for "sample bashrc".

While searching for additional aliases,
you're likely to encounter references to other common shell features to customize,
such as the color of your shell's background and text.
As mentioned in ChapterÂ \@ref(bash-basics),
another important feature to consider customizing is your shell prompt.\index{prompt (in Unix shell)}\index{Unix shell!prompt}
In addition to a standard symbol (like `$`),
your computer may include other information as well,
such as the working directory, username, and/or date/time.
If your shell does not include that information and you would like to see it,
or if your current prompt is too long and you'd like to shorten it,
you can include a line in your `.bashrc` file that defines `$PS1`:

```bash
PS1="\u \w $ "
```

This changes the prompt to include your username and current working directory:

```bash
amira ~/Desktop $
```

## Summary {#bash-advanced-summary}

As powerful as the Unix shell is,
it does have its shortcomings:
dollar signs, quotes, and other punctuation
can make a complex shell script look as though
it was created by a cat dancing on a keyboard.
However,
it is the glue that holds data science together:
shell scripts are used to create pipelines from miscellaneous sets of programs,
while shell variables are used to do everything from
specifying package installation directories to managing database login credentials.
And while `grep` and `find` may take some getting used to,
they and their cousins can handle enormous datasets very efficiently.
If you would like to go further,
@Ray2014 is an excellent general introduction,
while @Jans2014 looks specifically at how to process data on the command line.

## Exercises {#bash-advanced-exercises}

As with the previous chapter,
extra files and directories created during these exercises
may need to be removed when you are done.

### Cleaning up {#bash-advanced-ex-cleaning-up}

As we have gone through this chapter,
we have created several files that we won't need again.
We can clean them up with the following commands;
briefly explain what each line does.

```bash
$ cd ~/zipf
$ for file in $(find . -name "*.bak")
> do
>   rm $file
> done
$ rm bin/summarize_all_books.sh
$ rm -r results
```

### Variables in shell scripts {#bash-advanced-ex-script-variables}

Imagine you have a shell script called `script.sh` that contains:

```bash
head -n $2 $1
tail -n $3 $1
```

With this script in your `data` directory, you type the following command:

```bash
$ bash script.sh '*.txt' 1 1
```

Which of the following outputs would you expect to see?

1. All of the lines between the first and the last lines of each file ending in `.txt`
    in the `data` directory
2. The first and the last line of each file ending in `.txt` in the `data` directory
3. The first and the last line of each file in the `data` directory
4. An error because of the quotes around `*.txt`

### Find the longest file with a given extension {#bash-advanced-ex-longest-with-extension}

Write a shell script called `longest.sh` that takes the name of a
directory and a filename extension as its arguments, and prints
out the name of the file with the most lines in that directory
with that extension. For example:

```bash
$ bash longest.sh data/ txt
```

would print the name of the `.txt` file in `data` that has
the most lines.

### Script reading comprehension {#bash-advanced-ex-reading-scripts}

For this question, consider your `data` directory once again.
Explain what each of the following three scripts would do when run as
`bash script1.sh *.txt`, `bash script2.sh *.txt`, and `bash script3.sh *.txt` respectively.

```bash
# script1.sh
echo *.*
```

```bash
# script2.sh
for filename in $1 $2 $3
  do
    cat $filename
  done
```

```bash
# script3.sh
echo $@.txt
```

(You may need to search online to find the meaning of `$@`.)

### Using `grep` {#bash-advanced-ex-using-grep}

Assume the following text from *The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes*
is contained in a file called `excerpt.txt`:

```text
To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard
him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses
and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt
any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler.
```

Which of the following commands would provide the following output:

```text
and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt
```

1. `grep "he" excerpt.txt`
2. `grep -E "he" excerpt.txt`
3. `grep -w "he" excerpt.txt`
4. `grep -i "he" excerpt.txt`

### Tracking publication years {#bash-advanced-ex-year-script}

In ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-tools-ex-pipe-construction)
you examined code that extracted the publication year from a list of book titles.
Write a shell script called `year.sh` that takes any number of
filenames as command-line arguments,
and uses a variation of the code you used earlier to print a list
of the unique publication years appearing in each of those files separately.

### Counting names {#bash-advanced-ex-sense-sensibility}

You and your friend have just finished reading *Sense and Sensibility*
and are now having an argument.
Your friend thinks that the elder of the two Dashwood sisters,
Elinor,
was mentioned more frequently in the book,
but you are certain it was the younger sister, Marianne.
Luckily, `sense_and_sensibility.txt` contains the full text of the novel.
Using a `for` loop,
how would you tabulate the number of times each of the sisters is mentioned?

Hint: one solution might employ
the commands `grep` and `wc` and a `|`,
while another might utilize `grep` options.
There is often more than one way to solve a problem with the shell;
people choose solutions based on readability,
speed,
and what commands they are most familiar with.

### Matching and subtracting {#bash-advanced-ex-match-subtract}

Assume you are in the root directory of the `zipf` project.
Which of the following commands will find all files in `data` whose names end in `e.txt`,
but do *not* contain the word `machine`?

1.  `find data -name '*e.txt' | grep -v machine`
2.  `find data -name *e.txt | grep -v machine`
3.  `grep -v "machine" $(find data -name '*e.txt')`
4.  None of the above.

### `find` pipeline reading comprehension {#bash-advanced-ex-reading-find}

Write a short explanatory comment for the following shell script:

```bash
wc -l $(find . -name '*.dat') | sort -n
```

### Finding files with different properties {#bash-advanced-ex-find-tests}

The `find` command can be given criteria called "tests"
to locate files with specific attributes,
such as creation time, size, or ownership.
Use `man find` to explore these,
then write a single command using `-type`, `-mtime`, and `-user`
to find all files in or below your Desktop directory
that are owned by you and were modified in the last 24 hours.
Explain why the value for `-mtime` needs to be negative.

## Key Points {#bash-advanced-keypoints}


-   Save commands in files (usually called \gref{shell scripts}{shell_script}) for re-use.
-   `bash filename` runs the commands saved in a file.
-   `$@` refers to all of a shell script's command-line arguments.
-   `$1`, `$2`, etc., refer to the first command-line argument, the second command-line argument, etc.
-   Place variables in quotes if the values might have spaces or other special characters in them.
-   `find` prints a list of files with specific properties or whose names match patterns.
-   `$(command)` inserts a command's output in place.
-   `grep` selects lines in files that match patterns.
-   Use the `.bashrc` file in your home directory to set shell variables each time the shell runs.
-   Use `alias` to create shortcuts for things you type frequently.

# Building Command-Line Tools with Python {#scripting}

> Multiple exclamation marks are a sure sign of a diseased mind.
>
> --- Terry Pratchett\index{Pratchett, Terry}

The [Jupyter Notebook][jupyter], PyCharm, and other graphical interfaces
are great for prototyping code and exploring data,
but eventually we may need to apply our code to thousands of data files,
run it with many different parameters,
or combine it with other programs as part of a data analysis pipeline.
The easiest way to do this is often
to turn our code into a standalone program that can be run in the Unix shell
just like other command-line tools [@Tasc2017].

In this chapter we will develop some command-line Python programs\index{Python!command line}
that handle input and output in the same way as other shell commands,
can be controlled by several option flags,
and provide useful information when things go wrong.
The result will have more scaffolding than useful application code,
but that scaffolding stays more or less the same as programs get larger.

After the previous chapters,
our Zipf's Law project should have the following files and directories:

```text
zipf/
âââ bin
â   âââ book_summary.sh
âââ data
    âââ README.md
    âââ dracula.txt
    âââ frankenstein.txt
    âââ jane_eyre.txt
    âââ moby_dick.txt
    âââ sense_and_sensibility.txt
    âââ sherlock_holmes.txt
    âââ time_machine.txt
```

> **Python Style**
>
> When writing Python code there are many style choices to make.
> How many spaces should I put between functions?
> Should I use capital letters in variable names?
> How should I order all the different elements of a Python script?
> Fortunately,
> there are well established conventions and guidelines
> for good Python style.
> We follow those guidelines throughout this book
> and discuss them in detail in Appendix \@ref(style).

## Programs and Modules {#scripting-main}

To create a Python program that can run from the command line,\index{Python!program vs.\ module}
the first thing we do is to add the following to the bottom of the file:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
```

This strange-looking check tells us
whether the file is running as a standalone program
or whether it is being imported as a module by some other program.
When we import a Python file as a module in another program,
the `__name__` variable is automatically set to the name of the file.\index{\_\_name\_\_ variable (in Python)}\index{Python!\_\_name\_\_ variable}
When we run a Python file as a standalone program,
on the other hand,
`__name__` is always set to the special string `"__main__"`.
To illustrate this,
let's consider a script named `print_name.py`
that prints the value of the `__name__` variable:

```python
print(__name__)
```

When we run this file directly,
it will print `__main__`:

```bash
$ python print_name.py
```

```text
__main__
```

But if we import `print_name.py` from another file
or from the Python interpreter,
it will print the name of the file,
i.e., `print_name`.

```bash
$ python
```
```text
Python 3.7.6 (default, Jan  8 2020, 13:42:34) 
[Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)] :: 
Anaconda, Inc. on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license"
for more information.
```
```python
>>> import print_name
```
```text
print_name
```

Checking the value of the variable `__name__`
therefore tells us whether our file is the top-level program or not.
If it is,
we can handle command-line options, print help, or whatever else is appropriate;
if it isn't,
we should assume that some other code is doing this.

We could put the main program code directly under the `if` statement like this:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # code goes here
```

but that is considered poor practice,
since it makes testing harder (ChapterÂ \@ref(testing)).
Instead,
we put the high-level logic in a function,
then call that function if our file is being run directly:

```python
def main():
    # code goes here


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This top-level function is usually called `main`,
but we can use whatever name we want.

## Handling Command-Line Options {#scripting-options}

The main function in a program usually starts by
parsing any options the user gave on the command line.\index{option (of Python program)}\index{Python!option}
The most commonly used library for doing this in Python is [`argparse`][argparse],
which can handle options with or without arguments,
convert arguments from strings to numbers or other types,
display help,
and many other things.

The simplest way to explain how `argparse` works is by example.
Let's create a short Python program called `script_template.py`:

```python
import argparse


def main(args):
    print('Input file:', args.infile)
    print('Output file:', args.outfile)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    USAGE = 'Brief description of what the script does.'
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=USAGE)
    parser.add_argument('infile', type=str,
                        help='Input file name')
    parser.add_argument('outfile', type=str,
                        help='Output file name')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    main(args)
```

> **Empty Lines, Again**
> 
> As we discussed in the last chapter for shell scripts,
> remember to end your Python scripts in a newline character
> (which we view as an empty line).\index{whitespace}

If `script_template.py` is run as a standalone program at the command line,
then `__name__ == '__main__'` is true,
so the program uses `argparse` to create an argument parser.
It then specifies that it expects two command-line arguments:
an input filename (`infile`) and an output filename (`outfile`).
The program uses `parser.parse_args()` to parse the actual command-line arguments given by the user
and stores the result in a variable called `args`,
which it passes to `main`.
That function can then get the values using the names specified
in the `parser.add_argument` calls.

> **Specifying Types**
>
> We have passed `type=str` to `add_argument` to tell `argparse` that
> we want `infile` and `outfile` to be treated as strings.
> `str` is not quoted because it is not a string itself:
> instead,
> it is the built-in Python function that converts things to strings.
> As we will see below,
> we can pass in other functions like `int`
> if we want arguments converted to numbers.

If we run `script_template.py` at the command line,
the output shows us that `argparse` has successfully handled the arguments:

```bash
$ cd ~/zipf
$ python script_template.py in.csv out.png
```

```text
Input file: in.csv
Output file: out.png
```

It also displays an error message if we give the program invalid arguments:

```bash
$ python script_template.py in.csv
```

```text
usage: script_template.py [-h] infile outfile
script_template.py: error: the following arguments are
  required: outfile
```

Finally,
it automatically generates help information
(which we can get using the `-h` option):

```bash
$ python script_template.py -h
```

```text
usage: script_template.py [-h] infile outfile

Brief description of what the script does.

positional arguments:
  infile      Input file name
  outfile     Output file name

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

## Documentation {#scripting-docstrings}

Our program template is a good starting point,
but we improve it right away
by adding a bit of documentation.\index{Python!documenting}
To demonstrate,
let's write a function that doubles a number:

```python
def double(num):
    'Double the input.'
    return 2 * num
```

The first line of this function is a string
that isn't assigned to a variable.
Such a string is called a documentation string,
or \gref{docstring}{docstring} for short.\index{docstring (in Python)}\index{Python!docstring}
If we call our function it does what we expect:

```python
double(3)
```

```text
6
```

However,
we can also ask for the function's documentation,
which is stored in `double.__doc__`:\index{\_\_doc\_\_ variable (in Python)}

```python
double.__doc__
```

```text
'Double the input.'
```

Python creates the variable `__doc__` automatically for every function,
just as it creates the variable `__name__` for every file.
If we don't write a docstring for a function,
`__doc__`'s value is an empty string.
We can put whatever text we want into a function's docstring,
but it is usually used to provide online documentation.

We can also put a docstring at the start of a file,
in which case it is assigned to a variable called `__doc__`
that is visible inside the file.
If we add documentation to our template,
it becomes:

```python
"""Brief description of what the script does."""

import argparse


def main(args):
    """Run the program."""
    print('Input file:', args.infile)
    print('Output file:', args.outfile)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=__doc__)
    parser.add_argument('infile', type=str,
                        help='Input file name')
    parser.add_argument('outfile', type=str,
                        help='Output file name')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    main(args)
```

Note that docstrings are usually written using triple-quoted strings,\index{Python!triple-quoted strings}
since these can span multiple lines.
Note also how we pass `description=__doc__` to `argparse.ArgumentParser`.
This saves us from typing the same information twice,
but more importantly ensures that
the help message provided in response to the `-h` option
will be the same as the interactive help.

Let's try this out in an interactive Python session.
(Remember, do not type the `>>>` prompt:
Python provides this for us.)

```bash
$ python
```
```text
Python 3.7.6 (default, Jan  8 2020, 13:42:34) 
[Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)] :: 
Anaconda, Inc. on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license"
for more information.
```
```python
>>> import script_template
>>> script_template.__doc__
```
```text
'Brief description of what the script does.'
```
```python
>>> help(script_template)
```
```text
Help on module script_template:

NAME
    script_template - Brief description of what the script does.

FUNCTIONS
    main(args)
        Run the program.

FILE
    /Users/amira/script_template.py
```

As this example shows,
if we ask for help on the module,
Python formats and displays all of the docstrings for everything in the file.
We talk more about what to put in a docstring in AppendixÂ \@ref(documentation).

## Counting Words {#scripting-wordcount}

Now that we have a template for command-line Python programs,
we can use it to check Zipf's Law for our collection of classic novels.
We start by moving the template into the directory
where we store our runnable programs (SectionÂ \@ref(getting-started-organize)):

```bash
$ mv script_template.py bin
```

Next,
let's write a function that counts how often words appear in a file.
Our function splits the text on \gref{whitespace}{whitespace} characters
(which is the default behavior of the string object's `split` method),
then strips leading and trailing punctuation.
This isn't completely correct---if two words are joined by a long dash
like "correct" and "if" in this sentence, for example,
they will be treated as one word---but given that long dashes are used relatively infrequently,
it's close enough to correct for our purposes.
(We will submit a bug report about the long dash issue in SectionÂ \@ref(teams-bugs)).
We also use the `Counter` class from the `collections` library
to count how many times each word occurs.
If we give `Counter` a list of words,
the result is an object that contains
the number of times each one appears in the list:

```python
import string
from collections import Counter


def count_words(reader):
    """Count the occurrence of each word in a string."""
    text = reader.read()
    chunks = text.split()
    npunc = [word.strip(string.punctuation) for word in chunks] 
    word_list = [word.lower() for word in npunc if word]
    word_counts = Counter(word_list)
    return word_counts
```

Let's try our function on *Dracula*:

```python
with open('data/dracula.txt', 'r') as reader:
    word_counts = count_words(reader)
print(word_counts)
```

```text
Counter({'the': 8036, 'and': 5896, 'i': 4712, 'to': 4540,
         'of': 3738, 'a': 2961, 'in': 2558, 'he': 2543,
         'that': 2455, 'it': 2141, 'was': 1877, 'as': 1581,
         'we': 1535, 'for': 1534, ...})
```

If we want the word counts in a format like CSV for easier processing,
we can write another small function that takes our `Counter` object,
orders its contents from most to least frequent,
and then writes it to \gref{standard output}{stdout} as CSV:

```python
import sys
import csv


def collection_to_csv(collection):
    """Write collection of items and counts in csv format."""
    collection = collection.most_common()
    writer = csv.writer(sys.stdout)
    writer.writerows(collection)
```

Running this would print all the distinct words in the book
along with their counts.
This list could well be several thousand lines long,
so to make the output a little easier to view on our screen,
we can add an option to limit the output to the most frequent words.
We set its default value to `None`
so that we can easily tell if the caller *hasn't* specified a cutoff,
in which case we display the whole collection:

```python
def collection_to_csv(collection, num=None):
    """Write collection of items and counts in csv format."""
    collection = collection.most_common()
    if num is None:
        num = len(collection)
    writer = csv.writer(sys.stdout)
    writer.writerows(collection[0:num])
```

```python
collection_to_csv(word_counts, num=10)
```

```text
the,8036
and,5896
i,4712
to,4540
of,3738
a,2961
in,2558
he,2543
that,2455
it,2141
```

\newpage

To make our `count_words` and `collection_to_csv` functions available at the command line,
we need to insert them into our script template
and call them from within the `main` function.
Let's call our program `countwords.py`
and put it in the `bin` subdirectory of the `zipf` project:

```python
"""
Count the occurrences of all words in a text
and output them in CSV format.
"""

import sys
import argparse
import string
import csv
from collections import Counter


def collection_to_csv(collection, num=None):
    """Write collection of items and counts in csv format."""
    collection = collection.most_common()
    if num is None:
        num = len(collection)
    writer = csv.writer(sys.stdout)
    writer.writerows(collection[0:num])


def count_words(reader):
    """Count the occurrence of each word in a string."""
    text = reader.read()
    chunks = text.split()
    npunc = [word.strip(string.punctuation) for word in chunks]
    word_list = [word.lower() for word in npunc if word]
    word_counts = Counter(word_list)
    return word_counts


def main(args):
    """Run the command line program."""
    with open(args.infile, 'r') as reader:
        word_counts = count_words(reader)
    collection_to_csv(word_counts, num=args.num)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=__doc__)
    parser.add_argument('infile', type=str,
                        help='Input file name')
    parser.add_argument('-n', '--num',
                        type=int, default=None,
                        help='Output n most frequent words')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    main(args)
```

Note that we have replaced the `'outfile'` argument from our template script
with an optional `-n` (or `--num`) flag to control how much output is printed
and modified `collection_to_csv` so that it always prints to standard output.
If we want that output in a file,
we can redirect with `>`.

Let's take our program for a test drive:

```bash
$ python bin/countwords.py data/dracula.txt -n 10
```

```text
the,8036
and,5896
i,4712
to,4540
of,3738
a,2961
in,2558
he,2543
that,2455
it,2141
```

## Pipelining {#scripting-pipeline}

As discussed in SectionÂ \@ref(bash-tools-stdio),
most Unix commands follow a useful convention:
if the user doesn't specify the names of any input files,
they read from \gref{standard input}{stdin}.\index{standard input!in Python}
Similarly,
if no output file is specified,
the command sends its results to \gref{standard output}{stdout}.
This makes it easy to use the command in a pipeline.

Our program always sends its output to standard output;\index{standard output!in Python}
as noted above,
we can always redirect it to a file with `>`.
If we want `countwords.py` to read from standard input,
we only need to change the handling of `infile` in the argument parser
and simplify `main` to match:

```python
def main(args):
    """Run the command line program."""
    word_counts = count_words(args.infile)
    collection_to_csv(word_counts, num=args.num)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=__doc__)
    parser.add_argument('infile', type=argparse.FileType('r'),
                        nargs='?', default='-',
                        help='Input file name')
    parser.add_argument('-n', '--num',
                        type=int, default=None,
                        help='Output n most frequent words')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    main(args)
```

There are two changes to how `add_argument` handles `infile`:

1.  Setting `type=argparse.FileType('r')`
    tells `argparse` to treat the argument as a filename
    and open that file for reading.
    This is why we no longer need to call `open` ourselves,
    and why `main` can pass `args.infile` directly to `count_words`.

2.  The number of expected arguments (`nargs`) is set to `?`.
    This means that if an argument is given it will be used,
    but if none is provided,
    a default of `'-'` will be used instead.
    `argparse.FileType('r')` understands `'-'` to mean "read from standard input";
    this is another Unix convention that many programs follow.

After these changes,
we can create a pipeline like this
to count the words in the first 500 lines of a book:

```bash
$ head -n 500 data/dracula.txt | python bin/countwords.py --n 10
```

```text
the,227
and,121
of,116
i,98
to,80
in,58
a,49
it,45
was,42
that,41
```

## Positional and Optional Arguments {#scripting-positional-optional}

We have met two kinds of command-line arguments while writing `countwords.py`.
\gref{Optional arguments}{optional_argument}\index{option (of shell command)!optional}
are defined using a leading `-` or `--` (or both),
which means that all three of the following definitions are valid:

```python
parser.add_argument('-n', type=int, help='Limit output')
parser.add_argument('--num', type=int, help='Limit output')
parser.add_argument('-n', '--num',
                    type=int, help='Limit output')
```

The convention is for `-` to precede
a \gref{short}{short_option} (single letter) option\index{option (of shell command)!short}
and `--` a \gref{long}{long_option} (multi-letter) option.\index{option (of shell command)!long}
The user can provide optional arguments at the command line in any order they like.

\gref{Positional arguments}{positional_argument}\index{positional argument (of program)}
have no leading dashes and are not optional:
the user must provide them at the command line
in the order in which they are specified to `add_argument`
(unless `nargs='?'` is provided to say that the value is optional).

## Collating Results {#scripting-collate}

Ultimately,
we want to save the word counts to a CSV file for further analysis and plotting.
Let's create a subdirectory to hold our results
(following the structure described in SectionÂ \@ref(getting-started-structure)):

```bash
$ mkdir results
```

and then save the counts for various files:

```bash
$ python bin/countwords.py data/dracula.txt > results/dracula.csv
```

```bash
$ python bin/countwords.py data/moby_dick.txt >
  results/moby_dick.csv
```

```bash
$ python bin/countwords.py data/jane_eyre.txt >
  results/jane_eyre.csv
```

As in the previous chapter,
we've split long lines of code onto separate lines for formatting purposes;
each of the three code chunks above should be run as a single line of code.

Now that we can get word counts for individual books
we can collate the counts for several books.
This can be done using a loop that adds up the counts of a word
from each of the CSV files created by `countwords.py`.
Using the same template as before,
we can write a program called `collate.py`:

```python
"""
Combine multiple word count CSV-files
into a single cumulative count.
"""

import sys
import csv
import argparse
from collections import Counter


def collection_to_csv(collection, num=None):
    """Write collection of items and counts in csv format."""
    collection = collection.most_common()
    if num is None:
        num = len(collection)
    writer = csv.writer(sys.stdout)
    writer.writerows(collection[0:num])


def update_counts(reader, word_counts):
    """Update word counts with data from another reader/file."""
    for word, count in csv.reader(reader):
        word_counts[word] += int(count)


def main(args):
    """Run the command line program."""
    word_counts = Counter()
    for fname in args.infiles:
        with open(fname, 'r') as reader:
            update_counts(reader, word_counts)
    collection_to_csv(word_counts, num=args.num)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=__doc__)
    parser.add_argument('infiles', type=str, nargs='*',
                        help='Input file names')
    parser.add_argument('-n', '--num',
                        type=int, default=None,
                        help='Output n most frequent words')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    main(args)
```

The loop in the `main` function iterates over each filename in `infiles`,
opens the CSV file,
and calls `update_counts` with the input stream as one parameter
and the counter as the other.
`update_counts` then iterates through all the words in the CSV files
and increments the counts using the `+=` operator.

Note that we have not used `type=argparse.FileType('r')` here.
Instead,
we have called the option `infiles` (plural)
and specified `nargs='*'`
to tell `argparse` that we will accept zero or more filenames.
We must then open the files ourselves.

Let's give `collate.py` a try
(using `-n 10` to limit the number of lines of output):

```bash
$ python bin/collate.py results/dracula.csv
  results/moby_dick.csv results/jane_eyre.csv -n 10
```

\newpage

```text

```

## Writing Our Own Modules {#scripting-modules}

`countwords.py` and `collate.py` both now contain the function `collection_to_csv`.
Having the same function in two or more places is a bad idea:
if we want to improve it or fix a bug,
we have to find and change every single script that contains a copy.

The solution is to put the shared functions in a separate file
and load that file as a module.\index{Python!module}\index{module (in Python)}
Let's create a file called `utilities.py` in the `bin` directory
that looks like this:

```python
"""Collection of commonly used functions."""

import sys
import csv


def collection_to_csv(collection, num=None):
    """
    Write out collection of items and counts in csv format.

    Parameters
    ----------
    collection : collections.Counter
        Collection of items and counts
    num : int
        Limit output to N most frequent items
    """
    collection = collection.most_common()
    if num is None:
        num = len(collection)
    writer = csv.writer(sys.stdout)
    writer.writerows(collection[0:num])
```

Note that we have written a much more detailed docstring for `collection_to_csv`:
as a rule,
the more widely used code is,
the more it's worth explaining exactly what it does.

We can now import our utilities into our programs
just as we would import any other Python module
using either `import utilities` (to get the whole thing)
or something like `from utilities import collection_to_csv` (to get a single function).
After making this change,
`countwords.py` looks like this:

```python
"""
Count the occurrences of all words in a text
and write them to a CSV-file.
"""

import argparse
import string
from collections import Counter

import utilities as util


def count_words(reader):
    """Count the occurrence of each word in a string."""
    text = reader.read()
    chunks = text.split()
    npunc = [word.strip(string.punctuation) for word in chunks]
    word_list = [word.lower() for word in npunc if word]
    word_counts = Counter(word_list)
    return word_counts


def main(args):
    """Run the command line program."""
    word_counts = count_words(args.infile)
    util.collection_to_csv(word_counts, num=args.num)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=__doc__)
    parser.add_argument('infile', type=argparse.FileType('r'),
                        nargs='?', default='-',
                        help='Input file name')
    parser.add_argument('-n', '--num',
                        type=int, default=None,
                        help='Output n most frequent words')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    main(args)
```

`collate.py` is now:

```python
"""
Combine multiple word count CSV-files
into a single cumulative count.
"""

import csv
import argparse
from collections import Counter

import utilities as util


def update_counts(reader, word_counts):
    """Update word counts with data from another reader/file."""
    for word, count in csv.reader(reader):
        word_counts[word] += int(count)


def main(args):
    """Run the command line program."""
    word_counts = Counter()
    for fname in args.infiles:
        with open(fname, 'r') as reader:
            update_counts(reader, word_counts)
    util.collection_to_csv(word_counts, num=args.num)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=__doc__)
    parser.add_argument('infiles', type=str, nargs='*',
                        help='Input file names')
    parser.add_argument('-n', '--num',
                        type=int, default=None,
                        help='Output n most frequent words')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    main(args)
```

Any Python source file can be imported by any other.
This is why Python files should be named using \gref{snake case}{snake_case}\index{snake case}\index{naming conventions!snake case}
(e.g., `some_thing`)
instead of \gref{kebab case}{kebab_case}\index{kebab case}\index{naming conventions!kebab case}
(e.g., `some-thing`):
an expression like `import some-thing` isn't allowed
because `some-thing` isn't a legal variable name.
When a file is imported,
the statements in it are executed as it loads.
Variables, functions, and items defined in the file are then available as `module.thing`,
where `module` is the filename (without the `.py` extension)
and `thing` is the name of the item.

> **The `__pycache__` Directory**
>
> When we import a file,
> Python translates the source code into instructions called \gref{byte codes}{byte_code}\index{byte code}
> that it can execute efficiently.
> Since the byte codes only change when the source changes,
> Python saves the byte code in a separate file,
> and reloads that file instead of re-translating the source code
> the next time it's asked to import the file
> (unless the file has changed,
> in which case Python starts from the beginning).
>
> Python creates a subdirectory called `__pycache__`\index{\_\_pycache\_\_ directory}
> that holds the byte code for the files imported from that directory.
> We typically don't want to put the files in `__pycache__` in version control,
> so we normally tell Git to ignore it as discussed in SectionÂ \@ref(git-cmdline-ignore).

## Plotting {#scripting-plotting}

The last thing for us to do is to plot the word count distribution.
Recall that [Zipf's Law][zipfs-law] states the second most common word in a body of text
appears half as often as the most common,
the third most common appears a third as often, and so on.
Mathematically, this might be written as
"word frequency is proportional to 1/rank."

The following code plots the word frequency against the inverse rank
using the [pandas][pandas] library:

```python
import pandas as pd


input_csv = 'results/jane_eyre.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(input_csv, header=None,
                 names=('word', 'word_frequency'))
df['rank'] = df['word_frequency'].rank(ascending=False,
                                       method='max')
df['inverse_rank'] = 1 / df['rank']
scatplot = df.plot.scatter(x='word_frequency',
                           y='inverse_rank',
                           figsize=[12, 6],
                           grid=True)
fig = scatplot.get_figure()
fig.savefig('results/jane_eyre.png')
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/scripting/jane-eyre.png" alt="Word frequency distribution for Jane Eyre." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:scripting-repl)Word frequency distribution for Jane Eyre.</p>
</div>

You'll build on this code to create a plotting script for your project
in Exercise \@ref(scripting-ex-better-plotting).

## Summary {#scripting-summary}

Why is building a simple command-line tool so complex?
One answer is that the conventions for command-line programs
have evolved over several decades,
so libraries like `argparse` must now support several different generations of option handling.
Another is that the things we want to do genuinely *are* complex:
read from either standard input or a list of files,
display help when asked to,
respect parameters that might not be there,
and so on.
As with many other things in programming (and life),
everyone wishes it was simpler,
but no one can agree on what to throw away.

The good news is that this complexity is a fixed cost:
our template for command-line tools can be re-used for programs
that are much larger than the examples shown in this chapter.
Making tools that behave in ways people expect
greatly increases the chances that others will find them useful.

## Exercises {#scripting-exercises}

### Running Python statements from the command line {#scripting-ex-command-line}

We don't need to open the interactive interpreter to run Python code.
Instead,
we can invoke Python with the command flag `-c`
and the statement we want to run:

```python
$ python -c "print(2+3)"
```

```text
5
```

When and why is this useful?

### Listing files {#scripting-ex-glob-ls}

A Python library called [glob][glob] can be used to create a list of files
matching a pattern, much like the `ls` shell command.

```bash
$ python
```
```text
Python 3.7.6 (default, Jan  8 2020, 13:42:34) 
[Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)] :: 
Anaconda, Inc. on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license"
for more information.
```
```python
>>> import glob
>>> glob.glob('data/*.txt')
```
```text
['data/moby_dick.txt', 'data/sense_and_sensibility.txt',
'data/sherlock_holmes.txt', 'data/time_machine.txt',
'data/frankenstein.txt', 'data/dracula.txt',
'data/jane_eyre.txt']
```

Using `script_template.py` as a guide,
write a new script called `my_ls.py`
that takes as input a directory and a suffix (e.g., py, txt, md, sh)
and outputs a list of the files (sorted alphabetically)
in that directory ending in that suffix.

The help information for the new script should read as follows:

```bash
$ python bin/my_ls.py -h
```

```text
usage: my_ls.py [-h] dir suffix

List the files in a given directory with a given suffix.

positional arguments:
  dir         Directory
  suffix      File suffix (e.g. py, sh)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
```

\newpage

and an example of the output would be:

```bash
$ python bin/my_ls.py data/ txt
```

```text
data/dracula.txt
data/frankenstein.txt
data/jane_eyre.txt
data/moby_dick.txt
data/sense_and_sensibility.txt
data/sherlock_holmes.txt
data/time_machine.txt
```

Note: we will not be including this script in subsequent chapters.

### Sentence ending punctuation {#scripting-ex-sentence-endings}

Our `countwords.py` script strips the punctuation from a text,
which means it provides no information on sentence endings.
Using `script_template.py` and `countwords.py` as a guide,
write a new script called `sentence_endings.py` that counts
the occurrence of full stops, question marks and exclamation points
and prints that information to the screen.

Hint: String objects have a `count` method:

```bash
$ python
```
```text
Python 3.7.6 (default, Jan  8 2020, 13:42:34) 
[Clang 4.0.1 (tags/RELEASE_401/final)] :: 
Anaconda, Inc. on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license"
for more information.
```
```python
>>> "Hello! Are you ok?".count('!')
```
```text
1
```

When you're done,
the script should be able to accept an input file:

```bash
$ python bin/sentence_endings.py data/dracula.txt
```

```text
Number of . is 8505
Number of ? is 492
Number of ! is 752
```

or standard input:

```bash
$ head -n 500 data/dracula.txt | python bin/sentence_endings.py
```

```text
Number of . is 148
Number of ? is 8
Number of ! is 8
```

Note: we will not be including this script in subsequent chapters.

### A better plotting program {#scripting-ex-better-plotting}

Using `script_template.py` as a guide,
take the plotting code from SectionÂ \@ref(scripting-plotting)
and write a new Python program called `plotcounts.py`.
The script should do the following:

1. Use the `type=argparse.FileType('r')`, `nargs='?'` and `default='-'` options
   for the input file argument (i.e., similar to the `countwords.py` script)
   so that `plotcounts.py` uses standard input if no CSV file is given.

2. Include an optional `--outfile` argument for the name of the output image file.
   The default value should be `plotcounts.png`.

3. Include an optional `--xlim` argument so that the user can change the x-axis bounds.

When you are done,
generate a plot for *Jane Eyre* by passing the word counts to `plotcounts.py`
via a CSV file:

```bash
$ python bin/plotcounts.py results/jane_eyre.csv
  --outfile results/jane_eyre.png
```

and by standard input:

```bash
$ python bin/countwords.py data/jane_eyre.txt | python
  bin/plotcounts.py --outfile results/jane_eyre.png
```

Note:
the solution to this exercise is used in following chapters.


## Key Points {#scripting-keypoints}


-   Write command-line Python programs that can be run in the \gref{Unix shell}{shell} like other command-line tools.
-   If the user does not specify any input files, read from \gref{standard input}{stdin}.
-   If the user does not specify any output files, write to \gref{standard output}{stdout}.
-   Place all `import` statements at the start of a module.
-   Use the value of `__name__` to determine if a file is being run directly or being loaded as a module.
-   Use [`argparse`][argparse] to handle command-line arguments in standard ways.
-   Use \gref{short options}{short_option} for common controls and \gref{long options}{long_option} for less common or more complicated ones.
-   Use \gref{docstrings}{docstring} to document functions and scripts.
-   Place functions that are used across multiple scripts in a separate file that those scripts can import.

# Using Git at the Command Line {#git-cmdline}

> +++ Divide By Cucumber Error. Please Reinstall Universe And Reboot +++
>
> --- Terry Pratchett\index{Pratchett, Terry}

A \gref{version control system}{version_control_system} tracks changes to files\index{version control}
and helps people share those changes with each other.
These things can be done by emailing files to colleagues
or by using Microsoft Word and Google Docs,
but version control does both more accurately and efficiently.
Originally developed to support software development,
over the past fifteen years it has become the cornerstone
of \gref{reproducible research}{reproducible_research}.\index{reproducible research!version control}

Version control works by storing a master copy of your code in a repository,
which you can't edit directly.
Instead, you check out a working copy of the code,
edit that code, then commit changes back to the repository.
In this way, version control records a complete revision history (i.e., of every commit),
so that you can retrieve and compare previous versions at any time.
This is useful from an individual viewpoint,
because you don't need to store multiple (but slightly different) copies of the same script
(FigureÂ \@ref(fig:git-cmdline-phdcomics)).
It's also useful from a collaboration viewpoint,
because the system keeps a record of who made what changes and when.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/git-cmdline/phd-comics.png" alt="Managing different versions of a file without version control." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:git-cmdline-phdcomics)Managing different versions of a file without version control.</p>
</div>

There are many different version control systems,
such as CVS, Subversion, and Mercurial,
but the most widely used version control system today is \gref{Git}{git}.
Many people first encounter it through a GUI like [GitKraken][gitkraken]
or [the RStudio IDE][rstudio-ide].
However,
these tools are actually wrappers around Git's original command-line interface,
which gives us access to all of Git's features.
This lesson describes how to perform fundamental operations using that interface;
ChapterÂ \@ref(git-advanced) then introduces more advanced operations
that can be used to implement a smoother research workflow.

To show how Git works,
we will apply it to the Zipf's Law project.
Our project directory should currently include:

```text
zipf/
âââ bin
â   âââ book_summary.sh
â   âââ collate.py
â   âââ countwords.py
â   âââ plotcounts.py
â   âââ script_template.py
â   âââ utilities.py
âââ data
â   âââ README.md
â   âââ dracula.txt
â   âââ frankenstein.txt
â   âââ ...
âââ results
    âââ dracula.csv
    âââ jane_eyre.csv
    âââ jane_eyre.png
    âââ moby_dick.csv
```

`bin/plotcounts.py` is the solution to ExerciseÂ \@ref(scripting-ex-better-plotting);
over the course of this chapter
we will edit it to produce more informative plots.
Initially,
it looks like this:

```python
"""Plot word counts."""

import argparse

import pandas as pd


def main(args):
    """Run the command line program."""
    df = pd.read_csv(args.infile, header=None,
                     names=('word', 'word_frequency'))
    df['rank'] = df['word_frequency'].rank(ascending=False,
                                           method='max')
    df['inverse_rank'] = 1 / df['rank']
    ax = df.plot.scatter(x='word_frequency',
                         y='inverse_rank',
                         figsize=[12, 6],
                         grid=True,
                         xlim=args.xlim)
    ax.figure.savefig(args.outfile)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=__doc__)
    parser.add_argument('infile', type=argparse.FileType('r'),
                        nargs='?', default='-',
                        help='Word count csv file name')
    parser.add_argument('--outfile', type=str,
                        default='plotcounts.png',
                        help='Output image file name')
    parser.add_argument('--xlim', type=float, nargs=2,
                        metavar=('XMIN', 'XMAX'),
                        default=None, help='X-axis limits')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    main(args)
```

## Setting Up {#git-cmdline-setup}

We write Git commands as `git verb options`,
where the \gref{subcommand}{subcommand} `verb` tells Git what we want to do
and `options` provide whatever additional information that subcommand needs.
Using this syntax,
the first thing we need to do is configure Git.\index{Git!configuration}\index{configuration!Git}\index{Git commands!config}

```bash
$ git config --global user.name "Amira Khan"
$ git config --global user.email "amira@zipf.org"
```

(Please use your own name and email address instead of the one shown.)
Here,
`config` is the verb
and the rest of the command are options.
We put the name in quotation marks because it contains a space;
we don't actually need to quote the email address,
but do so for consistency.
Since we are going to be using GitHub,
the email address should be the same as you have or intend to use
when setting up your GitHub account.

The `--global` option tells Git to use the settings for all of our projects on this computer,
so these two commands only need to be run once.
However,
we can re-run them any time if we want to change our details.
We can also check our settings using the `--list` option:

```bash
$ git config --list
```

```text
user.name=Amira Khan
user.email=amira@zipf.org
core.autocrlf=input
core.editor=nano
core.repositoryformatversion=0
core.filemode=true
core.bare=false
core.ignorecase=true
...
```

Depending on your operating system and version of Git, 
your configuration list may look a bit different.
Most of these differences shouldn't matter right now,
as long as your username and email are accurate.

> **Git Help and Manual**
>
> If we forget a Git command,
> we can list which ones are available using `--help`:
>
> ```bash
> $ git --help
> ```
>
> This option also gives us more information about specific commands:
>
> ```bash
> $ git config --help
> ```

## Creating a New Repository {#git-cmdline-repos}

Once Git is configured,
we can use it to track work on our Zipf's Law project.
Let's make sure we are in the top-level directory of our project:

```bash
$ cd ~/zipf
$ ls
```

```text
 bin       data      results
```

We want to make this directory a \gref{repository}{repository},\index{repository (version control)}\index{Git commands!init}
i.e.,
a place where Git can store versions of our files.
We do this using the `init` command with `.` to mean "the current directory":

```bash
$ git init .
```

```text
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/amira/zipf/.git/
```

`ls` seems to show that nothing has changed:

```bash
$ ls
```

```text
bin     data    results
```

but if we add the `-a` flag to show everything,
we can see that Git has created a hidden directory within `zipf` called `.git`:\index{Git!.git directory}

```bash
$ ls -a
```

```text
.       ..      .git    bin     data    results
```

Git stores information about the project in this special subdirectory.
If we ever delete it,
we will lose that history.

We can check that everything is set up correctly
by asking Git to tell us the status of our project:

```bash
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be
  committed)

        bin/
        data/
        results/

nothing added to commit but untracked files
present (use "git add" to track)
```

"No commits yet" means that Git hasn't recorded any history yet,
while "Untracked files" means Git has noticed that
there are things in `bin/`, `data/` and `results/`
that it is not yet keeping track of.

## Adding Existing Work {#git-cmdline-add-existing}

Now that our project is a repository,
we can tell Git to start recording its history.
To do this,
we add things to the list of things Git is tracking using `git add`.\index{Git commands!add}
We can do this for single files:

```bash
$ git add bin/countwords.py
```

or entire directories:

```bash
$ git add bin
```

The easiest thing to do with an existing project
is to tell Git to add everything in the current directory using `.`:

```bash
$ git add .
```

We can then check the repository's status to see what files have been added:

```bash
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)

Adding all of our existing files this way is easy,
but we can accidentally add things that should never be in version control,
such as files containing passwords or other sensitive information.
The output of `git status` tells us that\index{Git commands!status}
we can remove such files from the list of things to be saved
using `git rm --cached`;\index{Git commands!rm}
we will practice this in ExerciseÂ \@ref(git-cmdline-ex-unsave).

We no longer have any untracked files,
but the tracked files haven't been \gref{committed}{commit}\index{Git commands!commit}\index{commit!to version control}
(i.e., saved permanently in our project's history).
We can do this using `git commit`:

```bash
$ git commit -m "Add scripts, novels, word counts, and plots"
```

```text

    counts, and plots

```

`git commit` takes everything we have told Git to save using `git add`
and stores a copy permanently inside the repository's `.git` directory.
This permanent copy is called a \gref{commit}{commit} or a \gref{revision}{revision}.\index{commit!set of files}
Git gives is a unique identifier,
and the first line of output from `git commit` displays
its \gref{short identifier}{short_identifier_git} `2dc78f0`,\index{Git!short identifier}\index{short identifier (in Git)}
which is the first few characters of that unique label.

We use the `-m` option (short for **m**essage)
to record a short comment with the commit
to remind us later what we did and why.
(Once again,
we put it in double quotes because it contains spaces.)
If we run `git status` now:

```bash
$ git status
```

the output tells us that
all of our existing work is tracked and up to date:

```text
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

This first commit becomes the starting point of our project's history:
we won't be able to see changes made before this point.
This implies that we should make our project a Git repository
as soon as we create it
rather than after we have done some work.

## Describing Commits {#git-cmdline-commit-message}

If we run `git commit` *without* the `-m` option,
Git opens a text editor
so that we can write a longer \gref{commit message}{commit_message}.\index{Git!commit message}\index{commit!message}
In this message,
the first line is referred to as the "subject"
and the rest as the "body",
just as in an email.

When we use `-m`,
we are only writing the subject line;
this makes things easier in the short run,
but if our project's history fills up with one-liners like
"Fixed problem" or "Updated",
our future self will wish that we had taken a few extra seconds
to explain things in a little more detail.
Following [these guidelines][desc-cmt-msgs] will help:

1.  Separate the subject from the body with a blank line
    so that it is easy to spot.
2.  Limit subject lines to 50 characters so that they are easy to scan.
3.  Write the subject line in Title Case (like a section heading).
4.  Do not end the subject line with a period.
5.  Write as if giving a command
    (e.g., "Make each plot half the width of the page").
6.  Wrap the body
    (i.e., insert line breaks to format text as paragraphs
    rather than relying on editors to wrap lines automatically).
7.  Use the body to explain what and why rather than how.

## Saving and Tracking Changes {#git-cmdline-changes}

Our initial commit gave us a starting point.
The process to build on top of it is similar:
first add the file, then commit changes.
Let's check that we're in the right directory:

```bash
$ pwd
```

```text
/Users/amira/zipf
```

Let's use `plotcounts.py` to plot the word counts in `results/dracula.csv`:

```bash
$ python bin/plotcounts.py results/dracula.csv --outfile
  results/dracula.png
```

If we check the status of our repository again,
Git tells us that we have a new file:

```bash
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be
  committed)
    results/dracula.png

nothing added to commit but untracked files
present (use "git add" to track)
```

Git isn't tracking this file yet because we haven't told it to.
Let's do that with `git add` and then commit our change:

```bash
$ git add results/dracula.png
$ git commit -m "Add plot of word counts for 'Dracula'"
```

```text
[master 851d590] Add plot of word counts for 'Dracula'
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 create mode 100644 results/dracula.png
```

If we want to know what we've done recently,
we can display the project's history using `git log`:\index{Git commands!log}

```bash
$ git log
```

```text
commit 851d590a214c7859eafa0998c6c951f8e0eb359b (HEAD -> master)
Author: Amira Khan <amira@zipf.org>
Date:   Sat Dec 19 09:32:41 2020 -0800

    Add plot of word counts for 'Dracula'

commit 173222bf90216b408c8997f4e143572b99637750
Author: Amira Khan <amira@zipf.org>
Date:   Sat Dec 19 09:30:23 2020 -0800

    Add scripts, novels, word counts, and plots
```

`git log` lists all commits made to a repository in reverse chronological order.
The listing for each commit includes
the commit's \gref{full identifier}{full_identifier_git}\index{Git!full identifier}\index{full identifier (in Git)}
(which starts with the same characters as the short identifier printed by `git commit`),
the commit's author,
when it was created,
and the commit message that we wrote.

The plot we have made is shown in FigureÂ \@ref(fig:git-cmdline-initial-plot).
It could be better:
most of the visual space is devoted to a few very common words,
which makes it hard to see what is happening with the other ten thousand or so words.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/git-cmdline/plot-initial.png" alt="Inverse rank versus word frequency for *Dracula*." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:git-cmdline-initial-plot)Inverse rank versus word frequency for *Dracula*.</p>
</div>

An alternative way to visually evaluate Zipf's Law is
to plot the word frequency against rank on log-log axes.
Let's change the section:

```python
    ax = df.plot.scatter(x='word_frequency',
                         y='inverse_rank',
                         figsize=[12, 6],
                         grid=True,
                         xlim=args.xlim)
```

to put `'rank'` on the y-axis and add `loglog=True`:

```python
    ax = df.plot.scatter(x='word_frequency',
                         y='rank', loglog=True,
                         figsize=[12, 6],
                         grid=True,
                         xlim=args.xlim)
```

When we check our status again,
it prints:

```bash
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be 
  committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in
  working directory)
	  modified:   bin/plotcounts.py

no changes added to commit (use "git add" or "git commit -a")
```

The last line tells us that
a file Git already knows about has been modified.

To save those changes in the repository's history,
we must `git add` and then `git commit`.
Before we do,
though,
let's review the changes using `git diff`.\index{Git commands!diff}\index{diff (in Git)}
This command shows us the differences between the current state of our repository
and the most recently saved version:

```bash
$ git diff
```

```diff
diff --git a/bin/plotcounts.py b/bin/plotcounts.py
index f274473..c4c5b5a 100644
--- a/bin/plotcounts.py
+++ b/bin/plotcounts.py
@@ -13,7 +13,7 @@ def main(args):
                                            method='max')
     df['inverse_rank'] = 1 / df['rank']
     ax = df.plot.scatter(x='word_frequency',
-                         y='inverse_rank',
+                         y='rank', loglog=True,
                          figsize=[12, 6],
                          grid=True,
                          xlim=args.xlim)
```

The output is cryptic,
even by the standards of the Unix command line,
because it is actually a series of commands telling editors and other tools
how to turn the file we *had* into the file we *have*.
If we break it down into pieces:

1.  The first line tells us that Git is producing output
    in the format of the Unix `diff` command.
2.  The second line tells exactly which versions of the file Git is comparing:
    `f274473` and `c4c5b5a` are the short identifiers for those versions.
3.  The third and fourth lines once again show the name of the file being changed;
    the name appears twice in case we are renaming a file as well as modifying it.
4.  The remaining lines show us the changes and the lines on which they occur.
    A minus sign `-` in the first column indicates a line that is being removed,
    while a plus sign `+` shows a line that is being added. Lines without either
    plus or minus signs have not been changed, but are provided around the lines
    that have been changed to add context.

Git's default is to compare line by line,
but it can be instructive to instead compare word by word
using the `--word-diff` or `--color-words` options.
These are particularly useful when running `git diff` on prose rather than code.

After reviewing our change
we can commit it just as we did before:

```bash
$ git commit -m "Plot frequency against rank on log-log axes"
```

```text
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be 
  committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in 
  working directory)
	  modified:   bin/plotcounts.py

no changes added to commit (use "git add" or "git commit -a")
```

Whoops:
we forgot to add the file to the set of things we want to commit.
Let's do that and then try the commit again:

```bash
$ git add bin/plotcounts.py
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	  modified:   bin/plotcounts.py
```

```bash
$ git commit -m "Plot frequency against rank on log-log axes"
```

```text

<p class="caption">(\#fig:git-cmdline-staging-area)The staging area in Git.</p>
</div>

Let's take a look at our new plot (FigureÂ \@ref(fig:git-cmdline-loglog-plot)):

```bash
$ python bin/plotcounts.py results/dracula.csv --outfile
  results/dracula.png
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<p class="caption">(\#fig:git-cmdline-loglog-plot)Rank versus word frequency on log-log axes for 'Dracula'.</p>
</div>

Running `git status` again shows that our plot has been modified:

```text
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be
  committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in
  working directory)
	  modified:   results/dracula.png

no changes added to commit (use "git add" or "git commit -a")
```

Since `results/dracula.png` is a binary file rather than text,
`git diff` can't show what has changed.
It therefore simply tells us that the new file is different from the old one:

```diff
diff --git a/results/dracula.png b/results/dracula.png
index c1f62fd..57a7b70 100644
Binary files a/results/dracula.png and 
b/results/dracula.png differ
```

This is one of the biggest weaknesses of Git
(and other version control systems):
they are built to handle text.
They can track changes to images, PDFs, and other formats,
but they cannot do as much to show or merge differences.
In a better world than ours,
programmers fixed this years ago.

If we are sure we want to save all of our changes,
we can add and commit in a single command
by giving `git commit` the `-a` option:

```bash
$ git commit -a -m "Update dracula plot"
```

```text
[master ee8684c] Update dracula plot
 1 file changed, 0 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)
 rewrite results/dracula.png (99%)
```

The Git commands we've covered so far (`git add`, `git commit`, `git diff`)
represent the tasks you perform in a basic Git workflow in a local repository 
(FigureÂ \@ref(fig:git-cmdline-remote)a).

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/git-cmdline/git-remote.png" alt="Commands included in basic Git workflows." width="100%" />

## Synchronizing with Other Repositories {#git-cmdline-remotes}

Sooner or later our computer will experience a hardware failure,
be stolen,
or be thrown in the lake by someone who thinks that
we shouldn't spend the entire vacation working on our thesis.
Even before that happens
we will probably want to collaborate with others,
which we can do by linking our local repository
to one stored on a hosting service such as [GitHub][github].

> **Where's My Repository?**
>
> So far we've worked with repositories located on your own computer,
> which we'll also refer to as local or desktop repositories.
> The alternative is hosting repositories on GitHub or another server,
> which we'll refer to as a remote or GitHub repository.

The first steps are to create an account on GitHub,
and then select the option there to create a new remote repository
to synchronize with our local repository.
Select the option on GitHub to create a new repository,
then add the requested information for your Zipf's Law project.
The remote repository doesn't have to have the same name as the local one,
but we will probably get confused if they are different,
so the repository we create on GitHub will also be called `zipf`.
The other default options are likely appropriate for your remote repository.
Because we are synchronizing with an existing repository,
do not add a README, `.gitignore`, or license;
we'll discuss these additions in other chapters.

\newpage

Next,
we need to connect our desktop repository with the one on GitHub.
We do this by making the GitHub repository a \gref{remote}{remote_repository}\index{Git!remote}\index{remote (in Git)}
of the local repository.
The home page of our new repository on GitHub includes the string we need to identify it
(FigureÂ \@ref(fig:git-cmdline-repo-link)).

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/git-cmdline/repo-link.png" alt="Find the link for a GitHub repository." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:git-cmdline-repo-link)Find the link for a GitHub repository.</p>
</div>

We can click on "HTTPS" to change the URL from SSH to HTTPS
and then copy that URL.

> **HTTPS vs. SSH**
>
> We use HTTPS here because it does not require additional configuration.
> If we want to set up SSH access so that we do not have to type in our password as often,
> the tutorials from [GitHub][git-ssh-github],
> [BitBucket][git-ssh-bitbucket],
> or [GitLab][git-ssh-gitlab]
> explain the steps required.

Next,
let's go into the local `zipf` repository and run this command:

```bash
$ cd ~/zipf
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf.git
```

\newpage

Make sure to use the URL for your repository instead of the one shown:
the only difference should be that it includes your username instead of `amira-khan`.

A Git remote is like a bookmark:\index{Git!remote}\index{Git commands!remote}\index{remote (in Git)}
it gives a short name to a URL.
In this case the remote's name is `origin`;
we could use anything we want,
but `origin` is Git's default,
so we will stick with it.
We can check that the command has worked by running `git remote -v`
(where the `-v` option is short for **v**erbose):

```bash
$ git remote -v
```

```text
origin	https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf.git (push)
```

Git displays two lines because it's actually possible to set up a remote
to download from one URL but upload to another.
Sensible people don't do this,
so we won't explore this possibility any further.

Now that we have configured a remote,
we can \gref{push}{git_push} the work we have done so far\index{Git commands!push}\index{push (in Git)}
to the repository on GitHub:

```bash
$ git push origin master
```

This may prompt us to enter our username and password;
once we do that,
Git prints a few lines of administrative information:

```text
Enumerating objects: 35, done.
Counting objects: 100% (35/35), done.
Delta compression using up to 4 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (35/35), done.
Writing objects: 100% (35/35), 2.17 MiB | 602.00 KiB/s, done.
Total 35 (delta 7), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (7/7), done.
To https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf.git
 * [new branch]      master -> master
```

If we view our GitHub repository in the browser,
it now includes all of our project files,
along with all of the commits we have made so far (FigureÂ \@ref(fig:git-cmdline-history)).

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/git-cmdline/repo-history.png" alt="Viewing the repository's history on GitHub." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:git-cmdline-history)Viewing the repository's history on GitHub.</p>
</div>

\newpage

We can also \gref{pull}{git_pull} changes\index{Git commands!pull}\index{pull (in Git)}
from the remote repository to the local one:

```bash
$ git pull origin master
```

```text
From https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Already up-to-date.
```

Pulling has no effect in this case
because the two repositories are already synchronized.

>
> The second line in the remote configuration we viewed earlier is labeled `push`,
> which makes sense given the command we used (`git push`)
> to upload changes from our local to remote repositories.
> Why is the other line labeled `fetch` instead of `pull`?

> but only pulling integrates those changes into your local repository's version history.

The Git commands we've covered in this section (`git pull`, `git push`)
are the main tasks associated with incorporating remote repositories into your workflow 
(FigureÂ \@ref(fig:git-cmdline-remote)b).

## Exploring History {#git-cmdline-history}

Git lets us look at previous versions of files
and restore specific files to earlier states if we want to.
In order to do these things,
we need to identify the versions we want.

The two ways to do this
are analogous to \gref{absolute}{absolute_path} and \gref{relative}{relative_path} paths.
The "absolute" version is the unique identifier that Git gives to each commit.
These identifiers are 40 characters long,
but in most situations Git will let us use just the first half dozen characters or so.
For example,
if we run `git log`\index{Git commands!log} right now,
it shows us something like this:

commit 851d590a214c7859eafa0998c6c951f8e0eb359b
Author: Amira Khan <amira@zipf.org>

    Add plot of word counts for 'Dracula'

commit 173222bf90216b408c8997f4e143572b99637750
Author: Amira Khan <amira@zipf.org>
Date:   Sat Dec 19 09:30:23 2020 -0800

    Add scripts, novels, word counts, and plots
```

The commit in which we changed `plotcounts.py`
has the absolute identifier `582f7f6f536d520b1328c04c9d41e24b54170656`,
but we can use `582f7f6` to reference it in almost all situations.

While `git log` includes the commit message,
it doesn't tell us exactly what changes were made in each commit.
If we add the `-p` option (short for **p**atch),
we get the same kind of details `git diff` provides
to describe the changes in each commit:

```bash
$ git log -p
```

The first part of the output is shown below;
we have truncated the rest,
since it is very long:

```diff

```

Alternatively,
we can use `git diff` directly\index{Git commands!diff}
to examine the differences between files at any stage in the repository's history.
Let's explore this with the `plotcounts.py` file.
We no longer need the line of code in `plotcounts.py`
that calculates the inverse rank:

```python
df['inverse_rank'] = 1 / df['rank']
```

If we delete that line from `bin/plotcounts.py`,
`git diff` on its own will show
the difference between the file as it is now and the most recent version:

```diff
diff --git a/bin/plotcounts.py b/bin/plotcounts.py

`git diff 582f7f6`,
on the other hand,
shows the difference between the current state
and the commit referenced by the short identifier:

Note that you will need to reference your `git log` to replace `582f7f6` in the code above,
since Git assigned your commit a different unique identifier.
Note also that we have *not* committed the last change to `plotcounts.py`;
we will look at ways of undoing it in the next section.

The "relative" version of history relies on a special identifier called `HEAD`,\index{Git!HEAD}\index{HEAD (in Git)}
which always refers to the most recent version in the repository.
`git diff HEAD` therefore shows the same thing as `git diff`,
but instead of typing in a version identifier to back up one commit,
we can use `HEAD~1` (where `~` is the tilde symbol).\index{Git!relative revision}
This shorthand is read "HEAD minus one,"
and gives us the difference to the previous saved version.
`git diff HEAD~2` goes back two revisions and so on.
We can also look at the differences between two saved versions
by separating their identifiers with two dots `..` like this:

```bash
$ git diff HEAD~1..HEAD~2
```

```diff
diff --git a/bin/plotcounts.py b/bin/plotcounts.py

If we wanted to view the contents of a file
at a given point in the version history, 
we could use the same command,
but separating the identifier and file with a colon:

```shell
$ git show HEAD~1:bin/plotcounts.py
```

This allows us to look through the file using a paging program.

## Restoring Old Versions of Files {#git-cmdline-restore}

We can see what we changed,
but how can we restore it?\index{Git!restore old versions}
Suppose we change our mind about the last update to `bin/plotcounts.py`
(removing `df['inverse_rank'] = 1 / df['rank']`)
before we add or commit it.
`git status` tells us that the file has been changed,
but those changes haven't been \gref{staged}{git_stage}:\index{Git!staging area}

```bash
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be 
  committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in 
  working directory)
	modified:   bin/plotcounts.py

no changes added to commit (use "git add" or "git commit -a")
```

We can put things back the way they were in the last saved revision 
using `git restore`,\index{Git commands!restore}
as the screen output suggests:

```bash
$ git restore bin/plotcounts.py
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

As its name suggests,
`git restore` restores an earlier version of a file.
In this case,
we used it to recover the version of the file in the most recent commit.

> **Checking Out with Git**
>
> If you're running a different version of Git,
> you may see a suggestion for `git checkout` instead of `git restore`.
> As of Git version 2.29,
> `git restore` is still an experimental command,
> and operates as a specialized form of `git checkout`.
> `git checkout HEAD bin/plotcounts.py` is equivalent to the last command run.\index{Git commands!checkout}

We can confirm the file has been restored
by printing the relevant lines of the file:

```bash
$ head -n 19 bin/plotcounts.py | tail -n 8
```

```text
    df['rank'] = df['word_frequency'].rank(ascending=False,
                                           method='max')
    df['inverse_rank'] = 1 / df['rank']
    ax = df.plot.scatter(x='word_frequency',
                         y='rank', loglog=True,
                         figsize=[12, 6],
                         grid=True,
                         xlim=args.xlim)
```

Because `git restore` is designed to restore working files, 
we'll need to use `git checkout` to revert to earlier versions of files.\index{Git commands!checkout}
We can use a specific commit identifier rather than `HEAD` to go back as far as we want:

```bash
$ git checkout 851d590 bin/plotcounts.py
```

```text
Updated 1 path from c8d6a33
```

Doing this does not change the history:
`git log` still shows our four commits.
Instead,
it replaces the content of the file with the old content:

```bash
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	  modified:   bin/plotcounts.py
```

```bash
$ head -n 19 bin/plotcounts.py | tail -n 8
```

```text
    df['rank'] = df['word_frequency'].rank(ascending=False,
                                           method='max')
    df['inverse_rank'] = 1 / df['rank']
    ax = df.plot.scatter(x='word_frequency',
                         y='inverse_rank',
                         figsize=[12, 6],
                         grid=True,
                         xlim=args.xlim)
```

If we change our mind again,
we can use the suggestion in the output to restore the earlier version.
Because checking out the changes added them to the staging area,
we need to first remove them from the staging area:

```bash
$ git restore --staged bin/plotcounts.py
```

However,
the changes have been unstaged but still exist in the file.
We can return the file to the state of the most recent commit:

```bash
$ git restore bin/plotcounts.py
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
```

```bash
$ head -n 19 bin/plotcounts.py | tail -n 8
```

```text
    df['rank'] = df['word_frequency'].rank(ascending=False,
                                           method='max')
    df['inverse_rank'] = 1 / df['rank']
    ax = df.plot.scatter(x='word_frequency',
                         y='rank', loglog=True,
                         figsize=[12, 6],
                         grid=True,
                         xlim=args.xlim)
```

We have restored the most recent commit.
Since we didn't commit the change
that removed the line that calculates the inverse rank,
that work is now lost:
Git can only go back and forth between committed versions of files.

This section has demonstrated a few different ways to view differences among versions,
and to work with those changes (FigureÂ \@ref(fig:git-cmdline-remote)c). 
These commands can operate on either individual files or entire commits,
and the behavior of them can sometimes differ based on your version of Git.
Remember to reference documentation,
and use `git status` and `git log` frequently to understand your workflow.

## Ignoring Files {#git-cmdline-ignore}

We don't always want Git to track every file's history.
For example,
we might want to track text files with names ending in `.txt`
but not data files with names ending in `.dat`.

To stop Git from telling us about these files every time we call `git status`,
we can create a file in the root directory of our project called `.gitignore`.\index{Git!ignoring files}\index{.gitignore file (in Git)}
This file can contain filenames like `thesis.pdf`
or \gref{wildcard}{wildcard} patterns like `*.dat`.\index{wildcard!in .gitignore}
Each must be on a line of its own,
and Git will ignore anything that matches any of these lines.
For now we only need one entry in our `.gitignore` file:

```text
__pycache__
```

which tells Git to ignore any `__pycache__` directory created by Python\index{\_\_pycache\_\_ directory!ignoring in Git}
(SectionÂ \@ref(scripting-modules)).

> **Remember to Ignore**
>
> Don't forget to commit `.gitignore` to your repository
> so that Git knows to use it.

## Summary {#git-cmdline-summary}

The biggest benefit of version control for individual research is that
we can always go back to the precise set of files
that we used to produce a particular result.
While Git is complex [@Pere2013],
being able to back up our changes on sites like GitHub
with just a few keystrokes can save us a lot of pain,
and some of Git's advanced features make it even more powerful.
We will explore these in the next chapter.

## Exercises {#git-cmdline-exercises}

### Places to create Git repositories {#git-cmdline-ex-places}

Along with information about the Zipf's Law project,
Amira would also like to keep some notes on [Heaps' Law][heaps-law].
Despite her colleagues' concerns,
Amira creates a `heaps-law` project inside her `zipf` project as follows:

```bash
$ cd ~/zipf
$ mkdir heaps-law
$ cd heaps-law
$ git init heaps-law
```

Is the `git init` command that she runs inside the `heaps-law` subdirectory
required for tracking files stored there?

### Removing before saving {#git-cmdline-ex-unsave}

If you're working on an older version of Git,
you may see an output from `git status` suggesting
you can take files out of the staging area
using `git rm --cached`.
Try this out:

1.  Create a new file in an initialized Git repository called `example.txt`.
2.  Use `git add example.txt` to add this file.
3.  Use `git status` to check that Git has noticed it.
4.  Use `git rm --cached example.txt` to remove it from the list of things to be saved.

What does `git status` now show?
What (if anything) has happened to the file?

### Viewing changes {#git-cmdline-ex-word-diff}

Make a few changes to a file in a Git repository,
then view those differences using both `git diff`
and `git diff --word-diff`.
Which output do you find easiest to understand?

Note: If you performed this exercise in your Zipf's Law project,
we recommend discarding (not committing)
your changes made to a file.

### Committing changes {#git-cmdline-ex-commit}

Which command(s) below would save changes to `myfile.txt` to a local Git repository?

```bash
# Option 1
$ git commit -m "Add recent changes"
```

```bash
# Option 2
$ git init myfile.txt
$ git commit -m "Add recent changes"
```

```bash
# Option 3
$ git add myfile.txt
$ git commit -m "Add recent changes"
   ```

```bash
# Option 4
$ git commit -m myfile.txt "Add recent changes"
```

### Write your biography {#git-cmdline-ex-bio}

1.  Create a new Git repository on your computer called `bio`.
Make sure the directory containing this repository is outside your `zipf` project directory! 
2.  Write a three-line biography for yourself in a file called `me.txt` and commit your changes.
3.  Modify one line and add a fourth line.
4.  Display the differences between the file's original state and its updated state.

### Committing multiple files {#git-cmdline-ex-multiple}

The staging area can hold changes from any number of files
that you want to commit as a single snapshot.
From your new `bio` directory,
following after the previous exercise (wich leaves you with uncommitted changes to `me.txt`):

1.  Create another new file `employment.txt`
    and add the details of your most recent job.

2.  Add the new changes to both `me.txt` and `employment.txt` to the staging area
    and commit those changes.

### GitHub timestamps {#git-cmdline-ex-timestamp}

1.  Create a remote repository on GitHub for your new `bio` repository.
2.  Push the contents of your local repository to the remote.
3.  Make a change to your local repository
    (e.g., edit `me.txt` or `employment.txt`)
    and push these changes as well.
4.  Go to the repo you just created on GitHub and check the timestamps of the files.

How does GitHub record times, and why?

### Workflow and history {#git-cmdline-ex-history}

Assume you made the following changes in your `bio` repository.
What is the output of the last command in the sequence below?

```bash
$ echo "Sharing information about myself." > motivation.txt
$ git add motivation.txt
$ echo "Documenting major milestones." > motivation.txt
$ git commit -m "Motivate project"
$ git restore motivation.txt
$ cat motivation.txt
```

1. `Sharing information about myself.`

2. `Documenting major milestones.`

3. ```text
Sharing information about myself.
Documenting major milestones.
```

4. An error message because we have changed `motivation.txt` without committing first.

### Ignoring nested files {#git-cmdline-ex-ignore-nested}

Suppose our project has a directory `results` with two subdirectories called `data` and `plots`.
How would we ignore all of the files in `results/plots`
but not ignore files in `results/data`?

### Including specific files {#git-cmdline-ex-include}

How would you ignore all `.dat` files in your root directory except for `final.dat`?
(Hint: find out what the exclamation mark `!` means in a `.gitignore` file.)

### Exploring the GitHub interface {#git-cmdline-ex-github-interface}

Browse to your `zipf` repository on GitHub.
Under the `Code` tab,
find and click on the text that says "NN commits" (where "NN" is some number).
Hover over and click on the three buttons to the right of each commit.
What information can you gather/explore from these buttons?
How would you get that same information in the shell?

### Push versus commit {#git-cmdline-ex-push-commit}

Explain in one or two sentences how `git push` is different from `git commit`.

### License and README files {#git-cmdline-ex-boilerplate}

When we initialized our remote `zipf` GitHub repo,
we didn't add a `README.md` or license file.
If we had,
what would have happened when we tried to link our local and remote repositories?

### Recovering older versions of a file {#git-cmdline-ex-recover}

Amira made changes this morning to a shell script called `data_cruncher.sh`
that she has been working on for weeks.
Her changes broke the script,
and she has now spent an hour trying to get it back in working order.
Luckily,
she has been keeping track of her project's versions using Git.
Which of the commands below can she use
to recover the last committed version of her script?

1.  `$ git checkout HEAD`
2.  `$ git checkout HEAD data_cruncher.sh`
3.  `$ git checkout HEAD~1 data_cruncher.sh`
4.  `$ git checkout <unique ID of last commit> data_cruncher.sh`
5.  `$ git restore data_cruncher.sh`
6.  `$ git restore HEAD`

### Understanding `git diff` {#git-cmdline-ex-diff}

Using your `zipf` project directory:

1.  What would the command `git diff HEAD~9 bin/plotcounts.py` do if we run it?
2.  What does it actually do?
3.  What does `git diff HEAD bin/plotcounts.py` do?

### Getting rid of staged changes {#git-cmdline-ex-unstage}

`git checkout` can be used to restore a previous commit when unstaged changes have been made,
but will it also work for changes that have been staged but not committed?
To find out,
use your `zipf` project directory to:

1.  Change `bin/plotcounts.py`.
2.  Use `git add` on those changes to `bin/plotcounts.py`.
3.  Use `git checkout` to see if you can remove your change.

Does it work?

### Figuring out who did what {#git-cmdline-ex-blame}

We never committed the last edit that removes the calculation of inverse rank.
Remove this line from `plotcounts.py`,
then commit the change:

```python
df['inverse_rank'] = 1 / df['rank']
```

Run the command `git blame bin/plotcounts.py`.
What does each line of the output show?

## Key Points {#git-cmdline-keypoints}


-   Use `git config` with the `--global` option to configure your username,
    email address, and other preferences once per machine.
-   `git init` initializes a \gref{repository}{repository}.
-   Git stores all repository management data in the `.git` subdirectory of the repository's root directory.
-   `git status` shows the status of a repository.
-   `git add` puts files in the repository's staging area.
-   `git commit` saves the staged content as a new commit in the local repository.
-   `git log` lists previous commits.
-   `git diff` shows the difference between two versions of the repository.
-   Synchronize your local repository with a \gref{remote repository}{remote_repository}
    on a \gref{forge}{forge} such as [GitHub][github].
-   `git remote` manages bookmarks pointing at remote repositories.
-   `git push` copies changes from a local repository to a remote repository.
-   `git pull` copies changes from a remote repository to a local repository.
-   `git restore` and `git checkout` recover old versions of files.
-   The `.gitignore` file tells Git what files to ignore.

# Going Further with Git {#git-advanced}

> It's got three keyboards and a hundred extra knobs, including twelve with '?' on them.
>
> --- Terry Pratchett\index{Pratchett, Terry}

Two of Git's advanced features let us to do much more than just track our work.
\gref{Branches}{git_branch} let us work on multiple things simultaneously in a single repository;
\gref{pull requests}{pull_request} (PRs) let us submit our work for review,
get feedback,
and make updates.
Used together,
they allow us to go through the write-review-revise cycle
familiar to anyone who has ever written a journal paper
in hours rather than weeks.

Your `zipf` project directory should now include:

```text
zipf/
âââ .gitignore
âââ bin
â   âââ book_summary.sh
â   âââ collate.py
â   âââ countwords.py
â   âââ plotcounts.py
â   âââ script_template.py
â   âââ utilities.py

    âââ jane_eyre.csv
    âââ jane_eyre.png
    âââ moby_dick.csv
```

\newpage

All of these files should also be tracked in your version history.
We'll use them and some additional analyses to explore Zipf's Law
using Git's advanced features.

## What's a Branch? {#git-advanced-branch-what}

So far we have only used a sequential timeline with Git:
each change builds on the one before,
and *only* on the one before.
However,
there are times when we want to try things out
without disrupting our main work.
To do this, we can use \gref{branches}{git_branch} to work on separate tasks in parallel.\index{branch (in Git)}\index{Git!branch}
Each branch is a parallel timeline;
changes made on the branch only affect that branch
unless and until we explicitly combine them with work done in another branch.

We can see what branches exist in a repository using this command:\index{Git commands!branch}

```bash
$ git branch
```

```text
* master
```

When we initialize a repository,
Git automatically creates a branch called `master`.\index{Git!master branch}
It is often considered the "official" version of the repository.
The asterisk `*` indicates that it is currently active,
i.e.,
that all changes we make will take place in this branch by default.
(The active branch is like the \gref{current working directory}{current_working_directory} in the shell.)

> **Default Branches**
> 
> In mid-2020,
> GitHub changed the name of the default branch
> (the first branch created when a repository is initialized) 
> from "master" to "main."
> Owners of repositories may also change the name of the default branch. 
> This means that the name of the default branch may be different among repositories
> based on when and where it was created,
> as well as who manages it.

In the previous chapter,
we foreshadowed some experimental changes that we could try and make to `plotcounts.py`.

Making sure our project directory is our working directory,
we can inspect our current `plotcounts.py`:

```bash
$ cd ~/zipf
$ cat bin/plotcounts.py
```

```python
"""Plot word counts."""

import argparse

import pandas as pd


def main(args):
    """Run the command line program."""
    df = pd.read_csv(args.infile, header=None,
                     names=('word', 'word_frequency'))
    df['rank'] = df['word_frequency'].rank(ascending=False,
                                           method='max')
    ax = df.plot.scatter(x='word_frequency',
                         y='rank', loglog=True,
                         figsize=[12, 6],
                         grid=True,
                         xlim=args.xlim)
    ax.figure.savefig(args.outfile)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=__doc__)
    parser.add_argument('infile', type=argparse.FileType('r'),
                        nargs='?', default='-',
                        help='Word count csv file name')
    parser.add_argument('--outfile', type=str,
                        default='plotcounts.png',
                        help='Output image file name')
    parser.add_argument('--xlim', type=float, nargs=2,
                        metavar=('XMIN', 'XMAX'),
                        default=None, help='X-axis limits')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    main(args)
```

We used this version of `plotcounts.py`
to display the word counts for *Dracula* on a log-log plot
(FigureÂ \@ref(fig:git-cmdline-loglog-plot)).
The relationship between word count and rank looked linear,
but since the eye is easily fooled,
we should fit a curve to the data.
Doing this will require more than just a trivial change to the script,
so to ensure that this version of `plotcounts.py` keeps working
while we try to build a new one,
we will do our work in a separate branch.
Once we have successfully added curve fitting to `plotcounts.py`,
we can decide if we want to merge our changes back into the `master` branch.

## Creating a Branch {#git-advanced-branch-how}

To create a new branch called `fit`,
we run:

```bash
$ git branch fit
```

We can check that the branch exists by running `git branch` again:

```bash
$ git branch
```

```text
* master
  fit
```

Our branch is there,
but the asterisk `*` shows that we are still in the `master` branch.
(By analogy,
creating a new directory doesn't automatically move us into that directory.)
As a further check,
let's see what our repository's status is:

```bash
$ git status
```

```text
On branch master
nothing to commit, working directory clean
```

To switch to our new branch we can use the `checkout` command\index{Git commands!checkout}
that we first saw in Chapter \@ref(git-cmdline):

```bash
$ git checkout fit
$ git branch
```

```text
  master
* fit
```

In this case,
we're using `git checkout` to check out a whole repository,
i.e., switch it from one saved state to another.

We should choose the name to signal the purpose of the branch,
just as we choose the names of files and variables to indicate what they are for.
We haven't made any changes since switching to the `fit` branch,
so at this point `master` and `fit` are at the same point in the repository's history.
Commands like `ls` and `git log` therefore show that the files and history haven't changed.

> **Where Are Branches Saved?**
>
> Git saves every version of every file in the `.git` directory\index{Git!.git directory}
> that it creates in the project's root directory.
> When we switch from one branch to another,
> it replaces the files we see with
> their counterparts from the branch we're switching to.
> It also rearranges directories as needed
> so that those files are in the right places.

## What Curve Should We Fit? {#git-advanced-theory}

Before we make any changes to our new branch,
we need to figure out how to fit a line to the word count data.
Zipf's Law says:

> The second most common word in a body of text
> appears half as often as the most common,
> the third most common appears a third as often, and so on.

In other words
the frequency of a word \(f\) is proportional to its inverse rank \(r\):

\[
f \propto \frac{1}{r^\alpha}
\]

with a value of \(\alpha\) close to one.
The reason \(\alpha\) must be close to one for Zipf's Law to hold
becomes clear if we include it in a modified version of the earlier definition:

> The most frequent word will occur approximately \(2^\alpha\) times
> as often as the second most frequent word,
> \(3^\alpha\) times as often as the third most frequent word, and so on.

This mathematical expression for Zipf's Law is an example of a \gref{power law}{power_law}.\index{power law}
In general, when two variables \(x\) and \(y\)
are related through a power law, so that \[
y = ax^b
\]
taking logarithms of both sides yields a linear relationship:

\[
\log(y) = \log(a) + b\log(x)
\]

Hence,
plotting the variables on a log-log scale reveals this linear relationship.
If Zipf's Law holds,
we should have

\[
r = cf^{\frac{-1}{\alpha}}
\]

where \(c\) is a constant of proportionality.
The linear relationship between the log word frequency and
log rank is then

\[
\log(r) = \log(c) - \frac{1}{\alpha}\log(f)
\]

This suggests that the points on our log-log plot should fall on a straight line
with a slope of \(- \tfrac{1}{\alpha}\)
and intercept \(\log(c)\).
To fit a line to our word count data we therefore need to estimate the value of \(\alpha\);
we'll see later that \(c\) is completely defined.

In order to determine the best method for estimating \(\alpha\), we turn to @More2016,
which suggests using a method called \gref{maximum likelihood estimation}{maximum_likelihood_estimation}.\index{maximum likelihood estimation}
The likelihood function is the probability of our observed data
as a function of the parameters in the statistical model that we assume generated it.
We estimate the parameters in the model by choosing them to maximize this likelihood;
computationally,
it is often easier to minimize the negative log likelihood function.
@More2016 define the likelihood using a parameter \(\beta\),
which is related to the \(\alpha\) parameter in our definition of Zipf's Law
through \(\alpha = \tfrac{1}{\beta-1}\).
Under their model,
the value of $c$ is the total number of unique words,
or equivalently the largest value of the rank.

\newpage

Expressed as a Python function,
the negative log likelihood function is:

```python
import numpy as np


def nlog_likelihood(beta, counts):
    """Log-likelihood function."""
    likelihood = - np.sum(np.log((1/counts)**(beta - 1)
                          - (1/(counts + 1))**(beta - 1)))
    return likelihood
```

Obtaining an estimate of \(\beta\) (and thus \(\alpha\))
then becomes a numerical optimization problem,
for which we can use the [`scipy.optimize`][scipy-optimize] library.
Again following @More2016,
we use Brent's Method with \(1 < \beta \leq 4\).

```python
from scipy.optimize import minimize_scalar


def get_power_law_params(word_counts):
    """Get the power law parameters."""
    mle = minimize_scalar(nlog_likelihood,
                          bracket=(1 + 1e-10, 4),
                          args=word_counts,
                          method='brent')
    beta = mle.x
    alpha = 1 / (beta - 1)
    return alpha
```

We can then plot the fitted curve on the plot axes (`ax`)
defined in the `plotcounts.py` script:

```python
def plot_fit(curve_xmin, curve_xmax, max_rank, alpha, ax):
    """
    Plot the power law curve that was fitted to the data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    curve_xmin : float
        Minimum x-bound for fitted curve
    curve_xmax : float
        Maximum x-bound for fitted curve
    max_rank : int
        Maximum word frequency rank.
    alpha : float
        Estimated alpha parameter for the power law.
    ax : matplotlib axes
        Scatter plot to which the power curve will be added.
    """
    xvals = np.arange(curve_xmin, curve_xmax)
    yvals = max_rank * (xvals**(-1 / alpha))
    ax.loglog(xvals, yvals, color='grey')
```

where the maximum word frequency rank corresponds to \(c\),
and \(-1 / \alpha\) the exponent in the power law.
We have followed the [`numpydoc`][numpydoc] format for the detailed docstring
in `plot_fit`---see Appendix \@ref(documentation) for more information
about docstring formats.

## Verifying Zipf's Law {#git-advanced-zipf-verify}

Now that we can fit a curve to our word count plots,
we can update `plotcounts.py` so the entire script reads as follows:

```python
"""Plot word counts."""

import argparse

import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from scipy.optimize import minimize_scalar


def nlog_likelihood(beta, counts):
    """Log-likelihood function."""
    likelihood = - np.sum(np.log((1/counts)**(beta - 1)
                          - (1/(counts + 1))**(beta - 1)))
    return likelihood


def get_power_law_params(word_counts):
    """Get the power law parameters."""
    mle = minimize_scalar(nlog_likelihood,
                          bracket=(1 + 1e-10, 4),
                          args=word_counts,
                          method='brent')
    beta = mle.x
    alpha = 1 / (beta - 1)
    return alpha

    """
    xvals = np.arange(curve_xmin, curve_xmax)
    yvals = max_rank * (xvals**(-1 / alpha))
    ax.loglog(xvals, yvals, color='grey')


def main(args):
    """Run the command line program."""
    df = pd.read_csv(args.infile, header=None,
                     names=('word', 'word_frequency'))
    df['rank'] = df['word_frequency'].rank(ascending=False,
                                           method='max')
    ax = df.plot.scatter(x='word_frequency',
                         y='rank', loglog=True,
                         figsize=[12, 6],
                         grid=True,
                         xlim=args.xlim)

    word_counts = df['word_frequency'].to_numpy()
    alpha = get_power_law_params(word_counts)
    print('alpha:', alpha)

    # Since the ranks are already sorted, we can take the last
    # one instead of computing which row has the highest rank
    max_rank = df['rank'].to_numpy()[-1]

    # Use the range of the data as the boundaries
    # when drawing the power law curve
    curve_xmin = df['word_frequency'].min()
    curve_xmax = df['word_frequency'].max()

    plot_fit(curve_xmin, curve_xmax, max_rank, alpha, ax)
    ax.figure.savefig(args.outfile)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=__doc__)
    parser.add_argument('infile', type=argparse.FileType('r'),
                        nargs='?', default='-',
                        help='Word count csv file name')
    parser.add_argument('--outfile', type=str,
                        default='plotcounts.png',
                        help='Output image file name')
    parser.add_argument('--xlim', type=float, nargs=2,
                        metavar=('XMIN', 'XMAX'),
                        default=None, help='X-axis limits')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    main(args)
```

We can then run the script to obtain the \(\alpha\) value for *Dracula*
and a new plot with a line fitted.

```bash
$ python bin/plotcounts.py results/dracula.csv --outfile
  results/dracula.png
```

```text
alpha: 1.0866646252515038
```

So according to our fit,
the most frequent word will occur approximately \(2^{1.1}=2.1\) times
as often as the second most frequent word,
\(3^{1.1}=3.3\) times as often as the third most frequent word, and so on.
FigureÂ \@ref(fig:git-advanced-dracula-fit) shows the plot.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/git-advanced/dracula-fit.png" alt="Word frequency distribution for Dracula." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:git-advanced-dracula-fit)Word frequency distribution for Dracula.</p>
</div>

The script appears to be working as we'd like,
so we can go ahead and commit our changes to the `fit` development branch:

```bash
$ git add bin/plotcounts.py results/dracula.png
$ git commit -m "Added fit to word count data"
```

```text
[fit 38c209b] Added fit to word count data
 2 files changed, 57 insertions(+)
 rewrite results/dracula.png (99%)
```

If we look at the last couple of commits using `git log`,
we see our most recent change:

```bash
$ git log --oneline -n 2
```

```text
38c209b (HEAD -> fit) Added fit to word count data
ddb00fb (origin/master, master) removing inverse rank
        calculation
```

(We use `--oneline` and `-nÂ 2` to shorten the log display.)
But if we switch back to the `master` branch:

```bash
$ git checkout master
$ git branch
```

```text
  fit
* master
```

and look at the log,
our change is not there:

```bash
$ git log --oneline -n 2
```

```text
ddb00fb (HEAD -> master, origin/master) removing inverse rank
        calculation
7de9877 ignoring __pycache__
```

We have not lost our work:
it just isn't included in this branch.
We can prove this by switching back to the `fit` branch and checking the log again:

```bash
$ git checkout fit
$ git log --oneline -n 2
```

```text
38c209b (HEAD -> fit) Added fit to word count data
ddb00fb (origin/master, master) removing inverse rank
        calculation
```

We can also look inside `plotcounts.py` and see our changes.
If we make another change and commit it,
that change will also go into the `fit` branch.
For instance,
we could add some additional information to one of our docstrings
to make it clear what equations were used in estimating \(\alpha\).

```python
def get_power_law_params(word_counts):

## Merging {#git-advanced-merge}

We could proceed in three ways at this point:

1.  Add our changes to `plotcounts.py` once again in the `master` branch.
2.  Stop working in `master` and start using the `fit` branch for future development.
3.  \gref{Merge}{git_merge} the `fit` and `master` branches.

The first option is tedious and error-prone;
the second will lead to a bewildering proliferation of branches,
but the third option is simple, fast, and reliable.\index{Git commands!merge}\index{merge (in Git)}
To start,
let's make sure we're in the `master` branch:

```bash
$ git checkout master
$ git branch
```

```text
  fit
* master
```

We can now merge the changes in the `fit` branch into our current branch
with a single command:

```bash
$ git merge fit
```

```text
Updating ddb00fb..1577404
Fast-forward
 bin/plotcounts.py   |  70 ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
                           +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 results/dracula.png | Bin 23291 -> 38757 bytes
 2 files changed, 70 insertions(+)
```

Merging doesn't change the source branch `fit`,
but once the merge is done,
all of the changes made in `fit` are also in the history of `master`:

```bash
$ git log --oneline -n 4
```

```text
1577404 (HEAD -> master, fit) Adding Moreno-Sanchez et al
        (2016) reference
38c209b Added fit to word count data
ddb00fb (origin/master) removing inverse rank calculation
7de9877 ignoring __pycache__
```

Note that Git automatically creates a new commit (in this case, `1577404`)
to represent the merge.
If we now run `git diff master..fit`,
Git doesn't print anything
because there aren't any differences to show.

Now that we have merged all of the changes from `fit` into `master`
there is no need to keep the `fit` branch,
so we can delete it:

```bash
$ git branch -d fit
```

```text
Deleted branch fit (was 1577404).

## Handling Conflicts {#git-advanced-conflict}

A \gref{conflict}{git_conflict} occurs\index{Git!conflict}\index{conflict!in Git}
when a line has been changed in different ways in two separate branches
or when a file has been deleted in one branch but edited in the other.
Merging `fit` into `master` went smoothly
because there were no conflicts between the two branches,
but if we are going to use branches,
we must learn how to merge conflicts.

To start,
use `nano` to add the project's title to
a new file called `README.md` in the `master` branch,
which we can then view:

```bash
$ cat README.md
```

```text
# Zipf's Law
```

```bash
$ git add README.md
$ git commit -m "Initial commit of README file"
```

```text
[master 232b564] Initial commit of README file
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 README.md
```

Now let's create a new development branch called `docs`
to work on improving the documentation for our code.
We will use `git checkout -b` to create a new branch and switch to it
in a single step:

```bash
$ git checkout -b docs
```

```text
Switched to a new branch 'docs'
```

```bash
$ git branch
```

```text
* docs
  master
```

On this new branch,
let's add some information to the README file:

```text
# Zipf's Law

These Zipf's Law scripts tally the occurrences of words in text
files and plot each word's rank versus its frequency.
```

```bash
$ git add README.md
$ git commit -m "Added repository overview"
```

```text
[docs a0b88e5] Added repository overview
 1 file changed, 3 insertions(+)
```

In order to create a conflict,
let's switch back to the `master` branch.
The changes we made in the `docs` branch are not present:

```bash
$ git checkout master
```

```text
Switched to branch 'master'
```

```bash
$ cat README.md
```

```text
# Zipf's Law
```

Let's add some information about the contributors to our work:

```text
# Zipf's Law

## Contributors

- Amira Khan <amira@zipf.org>
```

```
$ git add README.md
$ git commit -m "Added contributor list"
```

```text
[master 45a576b] Added contributor list
 1 file changed, 4 insertions(+)
```

We now have two branches,
`master` and `docs`,
in which we have changed `README.md` in different ways:

```bash
$ git diff docs..master
```

```diff
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
index f40e895..71f67db 100644
--- a/README.md
+++ b/README.md
@@ -1,4 +1,5 @@
 # Zipf's Law
 
-These Zipf's Law scripts tally occurrences of words in text
-files and plot each word's rank versus its frequency.
+## Contributors
+
+- Amira Khan <amira@zipf.org>
```

When we try to merge `docs` into `master`,
Git doesn't know which of these changes to keep:

```bash
$ git merge docs master
```

```text
Auto-merging README.md
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in README.md
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.
```

If we look in `README.md`,
we see that Git has kept both sets of changes,
but has marked which came from where:

```bash
$ cat README.md
```

```text
# Zipf's Law

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Contributors

- Amira Khan <amira@zipf.org>
=======
These Zipf's Law scripts tally the occurrences of words in text
files and plot each word's rank versus its frequency.
>>>>>>> docs
```

The lines from `<<<<<<<Â HEAD` to `=======` are what was in `master`,
while the lines from there to `>>>>>>>Â docs` show what was in `docs`.
If there were several conflicting regions in the same file,
Git would mark each one this way.

We have to decide what to do next:\index{Git!resolve conflict}\index{resolve conflict (in Git)}
keep the `master` changes,
keep those from `docs`,
edit this part of the file to combine them,
or write something new.
Whatever we do,
we must remove the `>>>`, `===`, and `<<<` markers.
Let's combine the two sets of changes
so the resulting file reads:

```text
# Zipf's Law

These Zipf's Law scripts tally the occurrences of words in text
files and plot each word's rank versus its frequency.

## Contributors

- Amira Khan <amira@zipf.org>
```

We can now add the file and commit the change,
just as we would after any other edit:

```bash
$ git add README.md
$ git commit -m "Merging README additions"
```

```text
[master 55c63d0] Merging README additions
```

Our branch's history now shows a single sequence of commits,
with the `master` changes on top of the earlier `docs` changes:

```bash
$ git log --oneline -n 4
```

```text
55c63d0 (HEAD -> master) Merging README additions
45a576b Added contributor list
a0b88e5 (docs) Added repository overview
232b564 Initial commit of README file
```

If we want to see what really happened,
we can add the `--graph` option to `git log`:

```bash
$ git log --oneline --graph -n 4
```

```text
*   55c63d0 (HEAD -> master) Merging README additions
|\  
| * a0b88e5 (docs) Added repository overview
* | 45a576b Added contributor list
|/  
* 232b564 Initial commit of README file
```

At this point we can delete the `docs` branch:

```bash
$ git branch -d docs
```

```text
Deleted branch docs (was a0b88e5).
```

Alternatively,
we can keep using `docs` for documentation updates.
Each time we switch to it,
we merge changes *from* `master` *into* `docs`,
do our editing
(while switching back to `master` or other branches as needed
to work on the code),
and then merge *from* `docs` *to* `master`
once the documentation is updated.

## A Branch-Based Workflow {#git-advanced-workflow}

What is the best way to incorporate branching into our regular coding practice?
If we are working on our own computer,
this workflow will help us keep track of what we are doing:

\newpage

1.  `git checkout master` to make sure we are in the `master` branch.

2.  `git checkout -b name-of-feature` to create a new branch.
    We *always* create a branch when making changes,
    since we never know what else might come up.
    The branch name should be as descriptive as a variable name or filename would be.

3.  Make our changes.
    If something occurs to us along the way---for example,
    if we are writing a new function and realize that
    the documentation for some other function should be updated---we do *not*
    do that work in this branch just because we happen to be there.
    Instead,
    we commit our changes,
    switch back to `master`,
    and create a new branch for the other work.

4.  When the new feature is complete,
    we `git merge master name-of-feature`
    to get any changes we merged into `master` after creating `name-of-feature`
    and resolve any conflicts.
    This is an important step:
    we want to do the merge and test that everything still works in our feature branch,
    not in `master`.

5.  Finally,
    we switch back to `master` and `git merge name-of-feature master`
    to merge our changes into `master`.
    We should not have any conflicts,
    and all of our tests should pass.

Most experienced developers use this
\gref{branch-per-feature workflow}{branch_per_feature_workflow},\index{branch-per-feature workflow (in Git)}\index{Git!branch-per-feature workflow}
but what exactly is a "feature"?
These rules make sense for small projects:

1.  Anything cosmetic that is only one or two lines long
    can be done in `master` and committed right away.
    Here,
    "cosmetic" means changes to comments or documentation:
    nothing that affects how code runs, not even a simple variable renaming.

2.  A pure addition that doesn't change anything else is a feature and goes into a branch.
    For example,
    if we run a new analysis and save the results,
    that should be done on its own branch
    because it might take several tries to get the analysis to run,
    and we might interrupt ourselves to fix things that we discover aren't working.

3.  Every change to code that someone might want to undo later in one step is a feature.
    For example,
    if a new parameter is added to a function,
    then every call to the function has to be updated.
    Since neither alteration makes sense without the other,
    those changes are considered a single feature and should be done in one branch.

The hardest thing about using a branch-per-feature workflow is sticking to it for small changes.
As the first point in the list above suggests,
most people are pragmatic about this on small projects;
on large ones,
where dozens of people might be committing,
even the smallest and most innocuous change needs to be in its own branch
so that it can be reviewed (which we discuss below).

## Using Other People's Work {#git-advanced-fork}

So far we have used Git to manage individual work,
but it really comes into its own when we are working with other people.
We can do this in two ways:

1.  Everyone has read and write access to a single shared repository.

2.  Everyone can read from the project's main repository,
    but only a few people can commit changes to it.
    The project's other contributors \gref{fork}{git_fork} the main repository\index{Git!fork a repository}\index{fork (in Git)}
    to create one that they own,
    do their work in that,
    and then submit their changes to the main repository.

The first approach works well for teams of up to half a dozen people
who are all comfortable using Git,
but if the project is larger,
or if contributors are worried that they might make a mess in the `master` branch,
the second approach is safer.

Git itself doesn't have any notion of a "main repository",
but \gref{forges}{forge} like [GitHub][github],
[GitLab][gitlab],
and [BitBucket][bitbucket] all encourage people
to use Git in ways that effectively create one.
Suppose,
for example,
that Sami wants to contribute to the Zipf's Law code that
Amira is hosting on GitHub at `https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf`.
Sami can go to that URL and click on the "Fork" button in the upper right corner
(FigureÂ \@ref(fig:git-advanced-fork-button)).
GitHub immediately creates a copy of Amira's repository within Sami's account on GitHub's own servers.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/git-advanced/fork-button.png" alt="Forking a repository." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:git-advanced-fork-button)Forking a repository.</p>
</div>

When the command completes,
the setup on GitHub now looks like FigureÂ \@ref(fig:git-advanced-after-fork).
Nothing has happened yet on Sami's own machine:
the new repository exists only on GitHub.
When Sami explores its history,
they see that it contains all of the changes Amira made.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/git-advanced/after-fork.png" alt="Repositories on GitHub after forking." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:git-advanced-after-fork)Repositories on GitHub after forking.</p>
</div>

A copy of a repository is called a \gref{clone}{git_clone}.\index{Git!clone a repository}\index{clone (in Git)}
In order to start working on the project,
Sami needs a clone of *their* repository (not Amira's) on their own computer.
We will modify Sami's prompt to include their desktop user ID (`sami`)
and working directory (initially `~`)
to make it easier to follow what's happening:\index{Git commands!clone}

\newpage

```bash
sami:~ $ git clone https://github.com/sami-virtanen/zipf.git
```

```text
Cloning into 'zipf'...

remote: Counting objects: 100% (64/64), done.

Receiving objects: 100% (64/64), 2.20 MiB | 2.66 MiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (20/20), done.
```

This command creates a new directory with the same name as the project,
i.e., `zipf`.
When Sami goes into this directory and runs `ls` and `git log`,
they see that all of the project's files and history are there:

```bash
sami:~ $ cd zipf
sami:~/zipf $ ls
```

```text
README.md       bin             data             results
```

```bash
sami:~/zipf $ git log --oneline -n 4
```

```text

        Merging README additions
45a576b Added contributor list
a0b88e5 Added repository overview
232b564 Initial commit of README file
```

Sami also sees that Git has automatically created a \gref{remote}{git_remote} for their repository\index{Git!remote}\index{remote (in Git)}
that points back at their repository on GitHub:

```bash
sami:~/zipf $ git remote -v
```

```text
origin  https://github.com/sami-virtanen/zipf.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/sami-virtanen/zipf.git (push)
```

Sami can pull changes from their fork and push work back there,
but needs to do one more thing before getting the changes from Amira's repository:

```bash
sami:~/zipf $ git remote add upstream
              https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf.git
sami:~/zipf $ git remote -v
```

```text
origin      https://github.com/sami-virtanen/zipf.git (fetch)
origin      https://github.com/sami-virtanen/zipf.git (push)
upstream    https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf.git (fetch)
upstream    https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf.git (push)
```

Sami has called their new remote `upstream` because it points at the repository
from which theirs is derived.\index{Git!upstream repository}\index{upstream repository (in Git)}
They could use any name,
but `upstream` is a nearly universal convention.

With this remote in place,
Sami is finally set up.
Suppose,
for example,
that Amira has modified the project's `README.md` file to add Sami as a contributor.
(Again, we show Amira's user ID and working directory in her prompt to make it clear who's doing what):

```text
# Zipf's Law

These Zipf's Law scripts tally the occurrences of words in text
files and plot each word's rank versus its frequency.

## Contributors

- Amira Khan <amira@zipf.org>
- Sami Virtanen
```

Amira commits her changes and pushes them to *her* repository on GitHub:

```bash
amira:~/zipf $ git commit -a -m "Adding Sami as a contributor"
```

```text

   55c63d0..35fca86  master -> master
```

\newpage

Amira's changes are now on her desktop and in her GitHub repository
but not in either of Sami's repositories (local or remote).
Since Sami has created a remote that points at Amira's GitHub repository,
though,
they can easily pull those changes to their desktop:

```bash
sami:~/zipf $ git pull upstream master
```

```text
From https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD

Updating 55c63d0..35fca86
Fast-forward
 README.md | 1 +
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

Pulling from a repository owned by someone else
is no different than pulling from a repository we own.
In either case,
Git merges the changes and asks us to resolve any conflicts that arise.
The only significant difference is that,
as with `git push` and `git pull`,
we have to specify both a remote and a branch:
in this case,
`upstream` and `master`.

## Pull Requests {#git-advanced-pull-requests}

Sami can now get Amira's work,
but how can Amira get Sami's?
She could create a remote that pointed at Sami's repository on GitHub
and periodically pull in Sami's changes,
but that would lead to chaos,
since we could never be sure that everyone's work was in any one place at the same time.
Instead,
almost everyone uses \gref{pull requests}{pull_request}.\index{pull request (in Git)}\index{Git!pull request}
They aren't part of Git itself,
but are supported by all major online \gref{forges}{forge}.

A pull request is essentially a note saying,
"Someone would like to merge branch A of repository B into branch X of repository Y."
The pull request does not contain the changes,
but instead points at two particular branches.
That way,
the difference displayed is always up to date
if either branch changes.

But a pull request can store more than just the source and destination branches:
it can also store comments people have made about the proposed merge.
Users can comment on the pull request as a whole,
or on particular lines,
and mark comments as out of date
if the author of the pull request updates the code that the comment is attached to.
Complex changes can go through several rounds of review and revision
before being merged,
which makes pull requests the review system we all wish journals actually had.

To see this in action,
suppose Sami wants to add their email address to `README.md`.
They create a new branch and switch to it:

```bash
sami:~/zipf $ git checkout -b adding-email
```

```text
Switched to a new branch 'adding-email'
```

then make a change and commit it:

```bash
sami:~/zipf $ git commit -a -m "Adding my email address"
```

```text
[adding-email 3e73dc0] Adding my email address
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)
```

```bash
sami:~/zipf $ git diff HEAD~1
```

```diff

```

Sami's changes are only in their local repository.
They cannot create a pull request until those changes are on GitHub,
so they push their new branch to their repository on GitHub:

```bash
sami:~/zipf $ git push origin adding-email
```

```text

```

When Sami goes to their GitHub repository in the browser,
GitHub notices that they have just pushed a new branch
and asks them if they want to create a pull request
(FigureÂ \@ref(fig:git-advanced-after-sami-pushes)).

<p class="caption">(\#fig:git-advanced-after-sami-pushes)Repository state after Sami pushes.</p>

When Sami clicks on the button,
GitHub displays a page showing the default source and destination of the pull request
and a pair of editable boxes for the pull request's title and a longer comment
(FigureÂ \@ref(fig:git-advanced-pull-request-start)).

If they scroll down,

\newpage

The top (title) box is autofilled with the previous commit message,
so Sami adds an extended explanation to provide additional context
before clicking on "Create Pull Request"
(FigureÂ \@ref(fig:git-advanced-pull-request-fill-in)).
When they do,
GitHub displays a page showing the new pull request,
which has a unique serial number
(FigureÂ \@ref(fig:git-advanced-pull-request-new)).
Note that this pull request is displayed in Amira's repository rather than Sami's,
since it is Amira's repository that will be affected if the pull request is merged.

Amira's repository now shows a new pull request
(FigureÂ \@ref(fig:git-advanced-pull-request-viewing)).
Clicking on the "Pull requests" tab brings up a list of PRs
(FigureÂ \@ref(fig:git-advanced-pull-request-list))
and clicking on the pull request link itself displays its details
(FigureÂ \@ref(fig:git-advanced-pull-request-details)).
Sami and Amira can both see and interact with these pages,
though only Amira has permission to merge.

Since there are no conflicts,
GitHub will let Amira merge the PR immediately using the "Merge pull request" button.
She could also discard or reject it without merging using the "Close pull request" button.
Instead,
she clicks on the "Files changed" tab to see what Sami has changed
(FigureÂ \@ref(fig:git-advanced-pull-request-changes)).

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

If she moves her mouse over particular lines,\index{Git!pull request!reviewing}\index{reviewing (Git pull request)}\index{code review!pull request}
a white-on-blue cross appears near the numbers to indicate that she can add comments
(FigureÂ \@ref(fig:git-advanced-pull-request-comment-marker)).
She clicks on the marker beside her own name and writes a comment:
She only wants to make one comment rather than write a lengthier multi-comment review,
so she chooses "Add single comment"
(FigureÂ \@ref(fig:git-advanced-pull-request-write-comment)).
GitHub redisplays the page with her remarks inserted

While Amira is working,
GitHub has been emailing notifications to both Sami and Amira.
When Sami clicks on the link in their email notification,
it takes them to the PR and shows Amira's comment.
Sami changes `README.md`,
commits,
and pushes,
but does *not* create a new pull request or do anything to the existing one.\index{Git!pull request!updating}
As explained above,
a PR is a note asking that two branches be merged,
so if either end of the merge changes,
the PR updates automatically.

Sure enough,
when Amira looks at the PR again a few moments later she sees Sami's changes
(FigureÂ \@ref(fig:git-advanced-pull-request-pr-with-fix)).
Satisfied,
she goes back to the "Conversation" tab and clicks on "Merge".
The icon at the top of the PR's page changes text and color to show that the merge was successful
(FigureÂ \@ref(fig:git-advanced-pull-request-successful-merge)).

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/git-advanced/pr-with-fix.png" alt="A pull request with a fix." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:git-advanced-pull-request-pr-with-fix)A pull request with a fix.</p>
</div>

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/git-advanced/pr-successful-merge.png" alt="After a successful merge." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:git-advanced-pull-request-successful-merge)After a successful merge.</p>
</div>

To get those changes from GitHub to her desktop repository,
Amira uses `git pull`:

\newpage

```bash
amira:~/zipf $ git pull origin master
```

```text
From https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Updating 35fca86..a04e3b9
Fast-forward
 README.md | 4 ++--
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
```

To get the change they just made from their `adding-email` branch into their `master` branch,
Sami could use `git merge` on the command line.
It's a little clearer,
though,
if they also use `git pull` from their `upstream` repository (i.e., Amira's repository)
so that they're sure to get any other changes that Amira may have merged:

```bash
sami:~/zipf $ git checkout master
```

```text
Switched to branch 'master'
Your branch is up to date with 'origin/master'.
```

```bash
sami:~/zipf $ git pull upstream master
```

```text
From https://github.com/amira-khan/zipf
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
Updating 35fca86..a04e3b9
Fast-forward
 README.md | 4 ++--
 1 file changed, 2 insertions(+), 2 deletions(-)
```

Finally,
Sami can push their changes back to the `master` branch
in their own remote repository:

```bash
sami:~/zipf $ git push origin master
```

```text
Total 0 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
To https://github.com/sami-virtanen/zipf.git
   35fca86..a04e3b9  master -> master
```

All four repositories are now synchronized.

## Handling Conflicts in Pull Requests {#git-advanced-pr-conflict}

Finally,
suppose that Amira and Sami have decided to collaborate more extensively on this project.
Amira has added Sami as a collaborator to the GitHub repository.
Now Sami can make contributions directly to the repository,
rather than via a pull request from a forked repository.

Sami makes a change to `README.md` in the `master` branch on GitHub.
Meanwhile, Amira is making a conflicting change to the same file in a different branch.\index{Git!pull request!conflict}
When Amira creates her pull request,
GitHub will detect the conflict and report that the PR cannot be merged automatically
(FigureÂ \@ref(fig:git-advanced-pr-conflict)).

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/git-advanced/pr-conflict.png" alt="Showing a conflict in a pull request." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:git-advanced-pr-conflict)Showing a conflict in a pull request.</p>
</div>

Amira can solve this problem with the tools she already has.
If she has made her changes in a branch called `editing-readme`,
the steps are:

1.  Pull Sami's changes from the `master` branch of the GitHub repository
    into the `master` branch of her desktop repository.

2.  Merge *from* the `master` branch of her desktop repository
    *to* the `editing-readme` branch in the same repository.

3.  Push her updated `editing-readme` branch to her repository on GitHub.
    The pull request from there back to the `master` branch of the main repository
    will update automatically.

GitHub and other forges do allow people to merge conflicts
through their browser-based interfaces,
but doing it on our desktop means we can use our favorite editor to resolve the conflict.
It also means that if the change affects the project's code,
we can run everything to make sure it still works.

But what if Sami or someone else merges another change
while Amira is resolving this one,
so that by the time she pushes to her repository
there is another, different, conflict?
In theory this cycle could go on forever;
in practice,
it reveals a communication problem that Amira (or someone) needs to address.
If two or more people are constantly making incompatible changes to the same files,
they should discuss who's supposed to be doing what,
or rearrange the project's contents so that they aren't stepping on each other's toes.

## Summary {#git-advanced-summary}

Branches and pull requests seem complicated at first,
but they quickly become second nature.
Everyone involved in the project can work at their own pace on what they want to,
picking up others' changes and submitting their own whenever they want.
More importantly,
this workflow gives everyone has a chance to review each other's work.
As we discuss in SectionÂ \@ref(style-review),
doing reviews doesn't just prevent errors from creeping in:
it is also an effective way to spread understanding and skills.

## Exercises {#git-advanced-exercises}

### Explaining options {#git-advanced-ex-explain-options}

1.  What do the `--oneline` and `-n` options for `git log` do?
2.  What other options does `git log` have that you would find useful?

### Modifying prompt {#git-advanced-ex-modify-prompt}

Modify your shell prompt so that it shows the branch you are on
when you are in a repository.

### Ignoring files {#git-advanced-ex-ignoring-files}

GitHub maintains [a collection of `.gitignore` files][github-gitignore]
for projects of various kinds.
Look at the sample `.gitignore` file for Python:
how many of the ignored files do you recognize?
Where could you look for more information about them?

### Creating the same file twice {#git-advanced-ex-create-twice}

Create a branch called `same`.
In it, create a file called `same.txt` that contains your name and the date.

Switch back to `master`.
Check that `same.txt` does not exist,
then create the same file with exactly the same contents.

1.  What will `git diff master..same` show?
    (Try to answer the question *before* running the command.)

2.  What will `git merge same master` do?
    (Try to answer the question *before* running the command.)

### Deleting a branch without merging {#git-advanced-ex-delete-unmerged}

Create a branch called `experiment`.
In it, create a file called `experiment.txt` that contains your name and the date,
then switch back to `master`.

1.  What happens when you try to delete the `experiment` branch using `git branch -d experiment`?
    Why?

2.  What option can you give Git to delete the `experiment` branch?
    Why should you be very careful using it?

3.  What do you think will happen if you try to delete the branch you are currently on using this flag?

### Tracing changes {#git-advanced-ex-trace-changes}

Chartreuse and Fuchsia are collaborating on a project.
Describe what is in each of the four repositories involved after each of the steps below.

1.  Chartreuse creates a repository containing a `README.md` file on GitHub
    and clones it to their desktop.
2.  Fuchsia forks that repository on GitHub
    and clones their copy to their desktop.
3.  Fuchsia adds a file `fuchsia.txt` to the `master` branch of their desktop repository
    and pushes that change to their repository on GitHub.
4.  Fuchsia creates a pull request from the `master` branch of their repository on GitHub
    to the `master` branch of Chartreuse's repository on GitHub.
5.  Chartreuse does *not* merge Fuchsia's PR.
    Instead,
    they add a file `chartreuse.txt` to the `master` branch of their desktop repository
    and push that change to their repository on GitHub.
6.  Fuchsia adds a remote to their desktop repository called `upstream`
    that points at Chartreuse's repository on GitHub
    and runs `git pull upstream master`,
    then merges any changes or conflicts.
7.  Fuchsia pushes from the `master` branch of their desktop repository
    to the `master` branch of their GitHub repository.
8.  Chartreuse merges Fuchsia's pull request.
9.  Chartreuse runs `git pull origin master` on the desktop.

## Key Points {#git-advanced-keypoints}


-   Use a \gref{branch-per-feature}{branch_per_feature} workflow to develop new features while leaving the master branch in working order.
-   `git branch` creates a new branch. 
-   `git checkout` switches between branches.
-   `git merge` \gref{merges}{git_merge} changes from another branch into the current branch.
-   \gref{Conflicts}{git_conflict} occur when files or parts of files are changed in different ways on different branches.
-   Version control systems do not allow people to overwrite changes silently;
    instead, they highlight conflicts that need to be resolved.
-   \gref{Forking}{git_fork} a repository makes a copy of it on a server.
-   \gref{Cloning}{git_clone} a repository with `git clone` creates a local copy of a remote repository.
-   Create a remote called `upstream` to point to the repository a fork was derived from.
-   Create \gref{pull requests}{pull_request} to submit changes from your fork to the upstream repository.

# Working in Teams {#teams}

> Evil begins when you begin to treat people as things.
>
> --- Terry Pratchett\index{Pratchett, Terry}

Projects can run for years with poorly written code,
but none will survive for long if people are confused,
pulling in different directions,
or hostile to each other.
This chapter therefore looks at how to create a culture of collaboration
that will help people who want to contribute to your project,
and introduce a few ways to manage projects and teams as they develop.
Our recommendations draw on @Foge2005,
which describes how good open source software projects are run,
and on @Boll2014,
which explains what a \gref{commons}{commons} is\index{commons}
and when it's the right model to use.

At this point,
the Zipf's Law project should include:

```

## What Is a Project? {#teams-scope}

The first decision we have to make is what exactly constitutes a "project" [@Wils2017].
Some examples are:

-   A dataset that is being used by several research projects.
    The project includes the raw data,
    the programs used to tidy that data,
    the tidied data,
    the extra files needed to make the dataset a package,
    and a few text files describing the data's authors, license, and \gref{provenance}{provenance}.

-   A set of annual reports written for an \gref{NGO}{ngo}.
    The project includes several Jupyter notebooks,
    some supporting Python libraries used by those notebooks,
    copies of the HTML and PDF versions of the reports,
    a text file containing links to the datasets used in the report
    (which can't be stored on GitHub since they contain personal identifying information),
    and a text file explaining details of the analysis that the authors didn't include in the reports themselves.

-   A software library that provides an interactive glossary of data science terms in both Python and R.
    The project contains the files needed to create a package in both languages,
    a Markdown file full of terms and definitions,
    and a Makefile with targets to check cross-references, compile packages, and so on.

Some common criteria for creating projects are one per publication,\index{project!scope}
one per deliverable piece of software,
or one per team.
The first tends to be too small:
a good dataset will result in several reports,
and the goal of some projects is to produce a steady stream of reports (such as monthly forecasts).
The second is a good fit for software engineering projects
whose primary aim is to produce tools rather than results,
but can be an awkward fit for data analysis work.
The third tends to be too large:
a team of half a dozen people may work on many different things at once,
and a repository that holds them all quickly looks like someone's basement.

One way to decide what makes up a project is to ask what people have meetings about.
If the same group needs to get together on a regular basis to talk about something,
that "something" probably deserves its own repository.
And if the list of people changes slowly over time but the meetings continue,
that's an even stronger sign.

## Include Everyone {#teams-inclusive}

Most research software projects begin as the work of one person,
who may continue to do the bulk of the coding and data analysis throughout its existence [@Maju2019].
As projects become larger,
though,
they eventually need more contributors to sustain them.
Involving more people also improves the functionality and robustness of the code,
since newcomers bring their own expertise or see old problems in new ways.

In order to leverage a group's expertise,
a project must do more than *allow* people to contribute:
its leaders must communicate that the project *wants* contributions,
and that newcomers are welcome and valued [@Shol2019].\index{project!inclusivity}\index{inclusivity}
Saying "the door is open" is not enough:
many potential contributors have painful personal experience of being less welcome than others.
In order to create a truly welcoming environment for everyone,
the project must explicitly acknowledge that some people are treated unfairly
and actively take steps to remedy this.
Doing this increases diversity within the team,
which makes it more productive [@Zhan2020].
More importantly,
it is the right thing to do.

> **Terminology**

> who is working to understand their own privilege and end oppression.

Encouraging inclusivity is a shared responsibility.
If we are privileged,
we should educate ourselves and call out peers who are marginalizing others,
even if (or especially if) they aren't conscious of doing it.
As project leaders,
part of our job is to teach contributors how to be allies
and to ensure an inclusive culture [@Lee1962].

## Establish a Code of Conduct {#teams-coc}

The starting point for making a project more inclusive is
to establish a Code of Conduct.\index{Code of Conduct (for project)}\index{project!Code of Conduct}
This does four things:

1.  It promotes fairness within a group.
2.  It reassures members of marginalized groups
    who have experienced harassment or unwelcoming behavior before
    that this project takes inclusion seriously.
3.  It ensures that everyone knows what the rules are.
    (This is particularly important when people come from different cultural backgrounds.)
4.  It prevents anyone who misbehaves from pretending that
    they didn't know what they did was unacceptable.

More generally,
a Code of Conduct makes it easier for people to contribute
by reducing uncertainty about what behaviors are acceptable.
Some people may push back claiming that it's unnecessary,
or that it infringes freedom of speech,
but what they usually mean is that
thinking about how they might have benefited from past inequity makes them feel uncomfortable.
If having a Code of Conduct leads to them going elsewhere,
that will probably make the project run more smoothly.

By convention,
we add a Code of Conduct to our project
by creating a file called `CONDUCT.md` in the project's root directory.\index{project files!CONDUCT}
Writing a Code of Conduct that is both comprehensive and readable is hard.
We therefore recommend using one that other groups have drafted, refined, and tested.
The [Contributor Covenant][covenant] is relevant for projects being developed online,
such as those based on GitHub:

```text
# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make
participation in our community a harassment-free experience for
everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible
disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and
expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic
status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or
sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an
open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment
for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and
  experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by
  our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but
  for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual
  attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or
  political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or
  email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered
  inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing
our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate
and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that
they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove,
edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues,
and other contributions that are not aligned to this
Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and
also applies when an individual is officially representing the
community in public spaces. Examples of representing our
community include using an official e-mail address, posting via
an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable
behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible
for enforcement at [INSERT CONTACT METHOD]. All complaints will
be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and
security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines
in determining the consequences for any action they deem in
violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other
behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community
leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation
and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate.
A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or
series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued
behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including
unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of
Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding
interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a
temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction
or public communication with the community for a specified
period of time. No public or private interaction with the
people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those
enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of
community standards, including sustained inappropriate
behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or
disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public
interaction within the community.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the
[Contributor Covenant][covenant],
version 2.0, available at
www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html

Community Impact Guidelines were inspired by
[Mozilla's code of conduct enforcement
ladder](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity).

[homepage]: https://www.contributor-covenant.org

For answers to common questions about this code of conduct,
see the FAQ at https://www.contributor-covenant.org/faq.
Translations are available at
https://www.contributor-covenant.org/translations.
```

As you can see,
the Contributor Covenant defines expectations for behavior,
the consequences of non-compliance,
and the mechanics of reporting and handling violations.
The third part is as important as the first two,
since rules are meaningless without a method to enforce them;
@Auro2018 is a short, practical guide that every project lead should read.

> **In-Person Events**
>
> The Contributor Covenant works well for interactions that are largely online,
> which is the case for many research software projects.
> The best option for in-person events is
> the [model Code of Conduct][model-coc] from the [Geek Feminism Wiki][geek-feminism],
> which is used by many open source organizations and conferences.
> If your project is sited at a university or within a company,
> it may already have Code of Conduct:
> the Human Resources department is usually the most helpful place to ask.

## Include a License {#teams-license}

While a Code of Conduct describes how contributors should interact with each other,
a license dictates how project materials can be used and redistributed.
If the license or a publication agreement makes it difficult for people to contribute,
the project is less likely to attract new members,\index{project!license}
so the choice of license is crucial to the project's long-term sustainability.

> **Open Except...**

> Teams working with sensitive data, on the other hand,
> must be careful to ensure that what should be private isn't inadvertently shared.
> In particular,
> people who are new to Git (and even people who aren't)

Every creative work has some sort of license;
the only question is whether authors and users know what it is and choose to enforce it.
Choosing a license for a project can be complex,
not least because the law hasn't kept up with everyday practice.
@Mori2012 and @Vand2014 are good starting points
to understand licensing and intellectual property from a researcher's point of view,
while @Lind2008 is a deeper dive for those who want details.
Depending on country, institution, and job role,
most creative works are automatically eligible for intellectual property protection.
However,
members of the team may have different levels of copyright protection.
For example,
students and faculty may have a copyright on the research work they produce,
but university staff members may not,
since their employment agreement may state that
what they create on the job belongs to their employer.

To avoid legal messiness,
every project should include an explicit license.
This license should be chosen early,
since changing a license can be complicated.
For example,
each collaborator may hold copyright on their work
and therefore need to be asked for approval when a license is changed.
Similarly,
changing a license does not change it retroactively,
so different users may wind up operating under different licensing structures.

> **Leave It to the Professionals**
>
> Don't write your own license.
> Legalese is a highly technical language,
> and words don't mean what you think they do.

To make license selection for code as easy as possible,
GitHub allows us to select one of several common software licenses when creating a repository.
The Open Source Initiative maintains [a list][osi-license-list] of \gref{open licenses}{open_license},
and [choosealicense.com][choose-license] will help us find a license that suits our needs.
Some of the things we need to think about are:

1.  Do we want to license the work at all?
2.  Is the content we are licensing source code?
3.  Do we require people distributing derivative works to also distribute their code?
4.  Do we want to address patent rights?
5.  Is our license compatible with the licenses of the software we depend on?
6.  Do our institutions have any policies that may overrule our choices?
7.  Are there any copyright experts within our institution who can assist us?

Unfortunately,
GitHub's list does not include common licenses for data or written works like papers and reports.
Those can be added in manually,
but it's often hard to understand the interactions among multiple licenses
on different kinds of material [@Alme2017].

Just as the project's Code of Conduct is usually placed in a root-level file called `CONDUCT.md`,
its license is usually put in a file called `LICENSE.md`\index{project files!LICENSE}
that is also in the project's root directory.

### Software {#teams-license-software}

In order to choose the right license for our software,
we need to understand the difference between two kinds of license.\index{open source license}
The \gref{MIT License}{mit_license}\index{MIT License}\index{open source license!MIT License}
(and its close sibling the BSD License)\index{BSD License}\index{open source license!BSD License}
say that people can do whatever they want to with the software as long as they cite the original source,
and that the authors accept no responsibility if things go wrong.
The \gref{GNU Public License}{gpl} (GPL)\index{GNU Public License (GPL)}\index{GPL (GNU Public License)}\index{open source license!GPL}
gives people similar rights,
but requires them to share their own work on the same terms:

> You may copy, distribute and modify the software as long as you track changes/dates in source files.
> Any modifications to or software including (via compiler) GPL-licensed code
> must also be made available under the GPL
> along with build and install instructions.
>
> --- [tl;dr][tldr-gpl]

In other words,
if someone modifies GPL-licensed software or incorporates it into their own project,
and then distributes what they have created,
they have to distribute the source code for their own work as well.

The GPL was created to prevent companies from taking advantage of open software
without contributing anything back.
The last thirty years have shown that this restriction isn't necessary:
many projects have survived and thrived without this safeguard.
We therefore recommend that projects choose the MIT license,
as it places the fewest restrictions on future action.

### Data and reports {#teams-license-other}

The MIT license, the GPL, and the Hippocratic License are intended for use with software.
When it comes to data and reports,
the most widely used family of licenses are those produced
by [Creative Commons][creative-commons].\index{Creative Commons}
These have been written and checked by lawyers and are well understood by the community.

The most liberal option is referred to as \gref{CC-0}{cc_license},\index{Creative Commons!CC-0 license}\index{public domain}
where the "0" stands for "zero restrictions."
This puts work in the public domain,
i.e.,
allows anyone who wants to use it to do so, however they want, with no restrictions.
CC-0 is usually the best choice for data,
since it simplifies aggregate analysis involving datasets from different sources.
It does not negate the scholarly tradition and requirement of citing sources;
it just doesn't make it a legal requirement.

The next step up from CC-0 is the Creative Commons--Attribution license,
usually referred to as \gref{CC-BY}{cc_license}.\index{Creative Commons!CC-BY license}\index{CC-BY license}
This allows people to do whatever they want to with the work
as long as they cite the original source.
This is the best license to use for manuscripts:
we want people to share them widely
but also want to get credit for our work.

Other Creative Commons licenses incorporate various restrictions,
and are usually referred to using two-letter abbreviations:

-   ND (no derivative works) prevents people from creating modified versions of our work.
    Unfortunately, this also inhibits translation and reformatting.

-   SA (share-alike) requires people to share work that incorporates ours
    on the same terms that we used.
    Again,
    it is fine in principle, but in practice it makes aggregation and recombination difficult.

-   NC (no commercial use) does *not* mean that people cannot charge money for something that includes our work,
    though some publishers still try to imply that in order to scare people away from open licensing.
    Instead,
    the NC clause means that people cannot charge for something that uses our work without our explicit permission,
    which we can give under whatever terms we want.

To apply these concepts to our Zipf's Law project,
we need to consider both our data (which other people created)
and our results (which we create).
We can view the license for the novels by looking in `data/README.md`,
which tells us that the Gutenberg Project books are in the public domain (i.e., CC-0).
This is a good choice for our results as well,
but after reflection,
we decide to choose CC-BY for our papers
so that everyone can read them (and cite them).

## Planning {#teams-planning}

Codes of conduct and licenses are a project's constitution,
but how do contributors know what they should actually be doing on any given day?
Whether we are working by ourselves or with a group of people,
the best way to manage this is to use an \gref{issue tracking system}{issue_tracking_system}
to keep track of tasks we need to complete or problems we need to fix.
\gref{Issues}{issue} are sometimes called \gref{tickets}{ticket},\index{project!issue}\index{issue (in project)}
so issue tracking systems are sometimes called \gref{ticketing systems}{ticketing_system}.\index{issue tracking system}
They are also often called \gref{bug trackers}{bug_tracker},
but they can be used to manage any kind of work,
and are often a convenient way to manage discussions as well.

\newpage

Like other \gref{forges}{forge},
GitHub allows participants to create issues for a project,
comment on existing issues,
and search all available issues.
Every issue can hold:

-   A unique ID, such as `#123`, which is also part of its URL.
    This makes issues easy to find and refer to:
    GitHub automatically turns the expression `#123` in a \gref{commit message}{commit_message}
    into a link to that issue.

-   A one-line title to aid browsing and search.

-   The issue's current status.
    In simple systems (like GitHub's) each issue is either open or closed,
    and by default,
    only open issues are displayed.
    Closed items are generally removed from default interfaces,
    so issues should only be closed when they no longer require any attention.

-   The user ID of the issue's creator.
    Just as `#123` refers to a particular issue,
    `@name` is automatically translated into a link to that person.
    The IDs of people who have commented on it or modified it are embedded in the issue's history,
    which helps figure out who to talk to about what.

-   The user ID of the person assigned to review the issue, if someone is assigned.

-   A full description that may include screenshots,
    error messages,
    and anything else that can be put in a web page.

-   Replies, counter-replies, and so on from people who are interested in the issue.

Broadly speaking,
people create three kinds of issues:

1.  \gref{Bug reports}{bug_report} to describe problems they have encountered.\index{bug report}

2.  \gref{Feature requests}{feature_request}\index{feature request}
    describing what could be done next,
    such as "add this function to this package" or "add a menu to the website."

3.  Questions about how to use the software,
    how parts of the project work,
    or its future directions.
    These can eventually turn into bug reports or feature requests,
    and can often be recycled as documentation.

## Bug Reports {#teams-bugs}

One steady supply of work in any active project is \gref{bug reports}{bug_report}.
Unsurprisingly,
a well-written bug report is more likely to get a fast response\index{bug report!style}
that actually addresses the problem [@Bett2008].
To write a good bug report:

1.  Make sure the problem actually *is* a bug.
    It's always possible that we have called a function the wrong way
    or done an analysis using the wrong configuration file.
    If we take a minute to double-check,
    or ask someone else on our team to check our logic,
    we could well fix the problem ourselves.

2.  Try to come up with a \gref{reproducible example}{reprex}
    or "reprex"\index{reproducible example (reprex)}\index{reprex (reproducible example)}
    that includes only the steps needed to make the problem happen,
    and that (if possible) uses simplified data rather than a complete dataset.
    Again,
    we can often solve the problem ourselves as we trim down the steps to create one.

3.  Write a one-line title for the issue
    and a longer (but still brief) description that includes relevant details.

4.  Attach any screenshots that show the problem,
    resulting errors,
    or (slimmed-down) input files needed to re-create it.

5.  Describe the version of the software we were using,
    the operating system we were running on,
    which version of the programming language we ran it with,
    and anything else that might affect behavior.
    If the software in question uses a logging framework (SectionÂ \@ref(errors-logging)),
    turn debugging output on and include it with the issue.

6.  Describe each problem separately so that each one can be tackled on its own.
    This parallels the rule about creating a branch in version control for each bug fix or feature
    discussed in SectionÂ \@ref(git-advanced).

An example of a well-written bug report with all of the components mentioned above
is shown in FigureÂ \@ref(fig:teams-bug-report).

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/teams/bug-report.png" alt="Example of a bug report." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:teams-bug-report)Example of a bug report.</p>
</div>

It takes time and energy to write a good error report.
If the report is being filed by a member of the development team,
the incentive to document errors well is that resolving the issue later is easier.
You can encourage users from outside the project to write thorough error reports
by including an issue template for your project.
An issue template is a file included in your GitHub repository
that proliferates each new issue with text that describes expectations
for content that should be submitted.
You can't force new issues to be as complete as you might like,
but you can use an issue template to make it easier for contributors to
remember and complete documentation about bug reports.

Sometimes the person creating the issue may not know or have the right answer for some of these things,
and will be doing their best with limited information about the error.
Responding with kindness and encouragement is important to maintain a healthy community,
and should be enforced by the project's Code of Conduct\index{Code of Conduct (for project)}
(SectionÂ \@ref(teams-coc)).

## Labeling Issues {#teams-labels}

The bigger or older a project gets,
the harder it is to find things---unless, that is,
the project's members put in a bit of work to make things findable [@Lin2020].
Issue trackers let project members add \gref{labels}{issue_label} to issues\index{issue (in project)!label}
to make things easier to search and organize.
Labels are also often called \gref{tags}{tag};\index{tags (for issues in project)}
whatever term is used,
each one is just a descriptive word or two.

GitHub allows project owners to define any labels they want.
A small project should always use some variation on these three:

-   *Bug*: something should work but doesn't.

-   *Enhancement*: something that someone wants added to the software.

-   *Task*: something needs to be done, but won't show up in code
    (e.g., organizing the next team meeting).

Projects also often use:

-   *Question*: where is something
    or how is something supposed to work?
    As noted above,
    issues with this label can often be recycled as documentation.

-   *Discussion* or *Proposal*: something the team needs to make a decision about
    or a concrete proposal to resolve such a discussion.
    All issues can have discussion:
    this category is for issues that start that way.
    (Issues that are initially labeled *Question*
    are often relabeled *Discussion* or *Proposal*
    after some back and forth.)

-   *Suitable for Newcomer* or *Beginner-Friendly*:
    to identify an easy starting point for someone who has just joined the project.
    If we help potential new contributors find places to start,
    they are more likely to do so [@Stei2014].

The labels listed above identify the kind of work an issue describes.
A separate set of labels can be used to indicate the state of an issue:

-   *Urgent*: work needs to be done right away.
    (This label is typically reserved for security fixes).

-   *Current*: this issue is included in the current round of work.

-   *Next*: this issue is (probably) going to be included in the next round.

-   *Eventually*: someone has looked at the issue and believes it needs to be tackled,
    but there's no immediate plan to do it.

-   *Won't Fix*: someone has decided that the issue isn't going to be addressed,
    either because it's out of scope or because it's not actually a bug.
    Once an issue has been marked this way,
    it is usually then closed.
    When this happens,
    send the issue's creator a note explaining why the issue won't be addressed
    and encourage them to continue working with the project.

-   *Duplicate*: this issue is a duplicate of one that's already in the system.
    Issues marked this way are usually also then closed;
    this is another opportunity to encourage people to stay involved.

Some of the labels that GitHub creates for repositories by default
are shown in FigureÂ \@ref(fig:teams-labels).
These labels can be modified or otherwise customized for each repository.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/teams/issue-labels.png" alt="Labels for GitHub issues." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:teams-labels)Labels for GitHub issues.</p>
</div>

Some projects use labels corresponding to upcoming software releases, journal issues, or conferences
instead of *Current*, *Next*, and *Eventually*.
This approach works well in the short term,
but becomes unwieldy as labels with names like `sprint-2020-08-01` and `spring-2020-08-16` pile up.

Instead,
a project team will usually create a \gref{milestone}{milestone},\index{milestone (in project)}\index{project!milestone}
which is a set of issues and pull requests in a single project repository.
GitHub milestones can have a due date
and display aggregate progress toward completion,
so the team can easily see when work is due and how much is left to be done.
Teams can also create projects,
which can include issues and pull requests from several repositories
as well as notes and reminders for miscellaneous tasks.

### Standardizing workflows {#teams-workflow}

Adding labels to issues also helps us standardize a workflow for the project.
Conventions about who can do what to issues with various labels,
and who can change those labels,
let us define a workflow like the one shown in FigureÂ \@ref(fig:teams-lifecycle).

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/teams/lifecycle.svg" alt="Example of issue lifecycle." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:teams-lifecycle)Example of issue lifecycle.</p>
</div>

-   An *Open* issue becomes *Assigned* when someone is made responsible for it.

-   They can then move the issue to *Canceled* if they think it was filed mistakenly
    or doesn't need to be fixed.
    (This is different from closing the issue after working on it.)

-   An *Assigned* issue becomes *Active* when someone starts to work on it.

-   When work is done it becomes *Ready for Review*.

-   From there it is either *Assigned* again because it needs more work
    or moved to *Fixed*,
    which means the change is ready to be incorporated into the project.

-   When the change is actually merged,
    the issue's state is changed to reflect that.

Small projects do not need this much formality,
but when the team is distributed,
contributors need to be able to find out what's going on
without having to wait for someone to respond to email
(or wondering who they *should* have emailed).

## Prioritizing {#teams-prioritize}

Between bug reports, feature requests, and general cleanup,
there is always more work to do than time to do it,
so every project needs some way to figure out what to focus on.
Labeling issues helps with \gref{triage}{triage},\index{triage (issues of project)}\index{project!triage (issues)}
which is the process of deciding what is a priority and what isn't.
This is never an easy job for software projects
that need to balance fixing bugs with creating new features,
and is even more challenging for research projects
for which "done" is hard to define
or whose team members are widely distributed
or do not all work for the same institution.

Many commercial and open source teams have adopted
\gref{agile development}{agile} as a solution to these problems.\index{agile development}
Instead of carefully formulating long-term plans that could be derailed by changing circumstances,
agile development uses a sequence of short development
\gref{sprints}{sprint},\index{sprint (of agile development)}\index{agile development!sprint}
each typically one or two weeks long.
Each sprint starts with a planning session lasting one or two hours
in which the successes and failures of the previous sprint are reviewed
and issues to be resolved in the current sprint are selected.
If team members believe an issue is likely to take longer than a single sprint to complete,
it should be broken into smaller pieces that *can* be finished
so that the team can track progress more accurately.
(Something large can be "90% done" for weeks;
with smaller items,
it's easier to see how much headway is being made.)

To decide which issues to work on in the next sprint,
a team can construct an \gref{impact/effort matrix}{impact_effort_matrix}\index{impact/effort matrix}
(FigureÂ \@ref(fig:teams-impact-effort)).
Impact measures how important the issue is to reaching the team's goals,
and is typically measured on a low--medium--high scale.
(Some teams use ratings from 1 to 10,
but this just leads to arguing over whether something is a 4 or a 5.)
Effort measures how much work the issue requires.
Since this can't always be estimated accurately,
it's common to classify things as "an hour," "a day," or "multiple days."
Again,
anything that's likely to take longer than multiple days should be broken down
so that planning and progress tracking can be more accurate.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/teams/effort-impact-matrix.svg" alt="An impact/effort matrix." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:teams-impact-effort)An impact/effort matrix.</p>
</div>

The impact/effort matrix makes the priorities for the coming sprint clear:
anything that is of high importance and requires little effort should be included,
while things of low importance that require a lot of effort should not.
The team must still make hard decisions, though:

-   Should a single large high-priority item be done,
    or should several smaller low-priority items be tackled instead?
-   What should be done about medium-priority items that keep being put off?

Each team has to answer these questions for each sprint,
but that begs the question of exactly who has the final say in answering them.
In a large project,
a \gref{product manager}{product_manager} decides how important items are,\index{product manager}\index{project!product manager}
while a \gref{project manager}{project_manager} is responsible for estimating effort\index{project manager}\index{project!project manager}
and tracking progress.
In a typical research software project
the principal investigator either makes the decision
or delegates that responsibility (and authority) to the lead developer.

Regardless of who is ultimately responsible,
it is essential to include project participants in the planning and decision making.
This may be as simple as having them add \gref{up-votes}{up_vote}\index{up-vote}
and \gref{down-votes}{down_vote}\index{down-vote} to issues
to indicate their opinions on importance,
or as complex as asking them to propose
a multi-sprint breakdown of a particularly complex feature.
Doing this shows people that their contributions are valued,
which in turn increases their commitment to doing the work.
It also produces better plans,
since everyone knows something that someone else doesn't.

## Meetings {#teams-meetings}

Pull requests and GitHub issues are good tools for asynchronous work,
but team meetings are often a more efficient way to make decisions,
and help build a sense of community.
Knowing how to run a meeting well\index{project!meetings}\index{meetings!how to run}
is as important as knowing how to use version control;
the rules doing so are simple but rarely followed:

Decide if there actually needs to be a meeting.
:   If the only purpose is to share information,
    have everyone send a brief email instead.
    Remember, people can read faster than they can speak:
    if someone has facts for the rest of the team to absorb,
    the most polite way to communicate them is to type them in.

Write an agenda.
:   If nobody cares enough about the meeting to prepare a point-form list of what's to be discussed,
    the meeting itself probably doesn't need to happen.
    Note that "the agenda is all the open issues in our GitHub repo" doesn't count.

Include timings in the agenda.
:   Timings help prevent early items stealing time from later ones.
    The first estimates with any new group are inevitably optimistic,
    so we should revise them upward for subsequent meetings.
    However,
    we shouldn't have a second or third meeting just because the first one ran over-time:
    instead, we should try to figure out *why* we're running over and fix the underlying problem.

Prioritize.
:   Tackle issues that will have high impact but take little time first,
    and things that will take more time but have less impact later.
    That way, if the first things run over time,
    the meeting will still have accomplished something.

Make one person responsible for keeping things moving.
:   One person should be made moderator
    and be responsible for keeping items to time,
    chiding people who are having side conversations or checking email,
    and asking people who are talking too much to get to the point.
    The moderator should *not* do all the talking:
    in fact,
    whoever is in charge will talk less in a well-run meeting than most other participants.
    This should be a rotating duty among members.

Require politeness.
:   No one gets to be rude,
    no one gets to ramble,
    and if someone goes off topic,
    it's the moderator's job to say,
    "Let's discuss that elsewhere."

No interruptions.
:   Participants should raise a finger, hand,
    put up a sticky note,
    or make another well understood gesture to indicate
    when they want to speak.
    The moderator should keep track of who wants to speak and give them time in turn.

No distractions.
:   Side conversations make meetings less efficient because
    nobody can actually pay attention to two things at once.
    Similarly,
    if someone is checking their email or texting a friend during a meeting,
    it's a clear signal that they don't think the speaker or their work is important.
    This doesn't mean a complete ban on technology---people may need accessibility aids,
    or may be waiting for a call from a dependent---but by default,
    phones should be face down and laptops should be closed
    during in-person meetings.

Take minutes.
:   Someone other than the moderator should take point-form notes
    about the most important information that was shared,
    and about every decision that was made or every task that was assigned to someone.
    This should be a rotating duty among members.

End early.
:   If the meeting is scheduled for 10:00--11:00,
    aim to end at 10:50 to give people a break before whatever they're doing next.

As soon as the meeting is over,
circulate the minutes by emailing them to everyone\index{project!meeting minutes}\index{meetings!minutes}
or adding a text file to the project's repository:

People who weren't at the meeting can follow what's going on.
:   We all have to juggle tasks from several projects or courses,
    which means that sometimes we can't make it to meetings.
    Checking a written record
    is a more accurate and efficient way to catch up than asking a colleague,
    "So, what did I miss?"

Everyone can check what was actually said or promised.
:   More than once,
    one of us has looked over the minutes of a meeting and thought,
    "Did I say that?" or,
    "I didn't promise to have it ready then!"
    Accidentally or not,
    people will often remember things differently;
    writing them down gives everyone a chance to correct mistakes,
    misinterpretations,
    or misrepresentations.

People can be held accountable at subsequent meetings.
:   There's no point making lists of questions and action items
    if we don't follow up on them later.
    If we are using an issue-tracking system,
    we should create a ticket for each new question or task right after the meeting
    and update those that are being carried forward.
    This helps a lot when the time comes to draw up the agenda for the next meeting.

### Air time {#teams-fair}

One of the problems in a synchronous meeting
is the tendency of some people to speak far more than others.
Other meeting members may be so accustomed to this
that they don't speak up even when they have valuable points to make.\index{meetings!how to run}

One way to combat this is to give everyone \gref{three sticky notes}{three_stickies}
at the start of the meeting.
Every time they speak,
they have to give up one sticky note.
When they're out of stickies,
they aren't allowed to speak until everyone has used at least one,
at which point everyone gets all of their sticky notes back.
This ensures that nobody talks more than three times as often as
the quietest person in the meeting,
and completely changes group dynamics.
People who have given up trying to be heard
suddenly have space to contribute,
and the overly frequent speakers realize how unfair they have been.

Another useful technique is called \gref{interruption bingo}{interruption_bingo}.
Draw a grid and label the rows and columns with the participants' names.
Each time one person interrupts another,
add a tally mark to the appropriate cell;
halfway through the meeting,
take a moment to look at the results.
In most cases it will be clear that
one or two people are doing all of the interrupting.
After that, saying, "All right, I'm adding another tally to the bingo card,"
is often enough to get them to throttle back.

### Online meetings {#teams-online}

Online meetings provide special challenges,\index{meetings!online}
both in the context of regulating how often individuals speak,
as well as running meetings in general.
@Troy2018 discusses why online meetings are often frustrating and unproductive and
points out that in most online meetings,
the first person to speak during a pause gets the floor.
As a result,
"If you have something you want to say,
you have to stop listening to the person currently speaking
and instead focus on when they're gonna pause or finish
so you can leap into that nanosecond of silence and be the first to utter something.
The format...encourages participants who want to contribute
to say more and listen less."

The solution is to run a text chat beside the video conference
where people can signal that they want to speak.
The moderator can then select people from the waiting list.
This practice can be reinforced by having everyone mute themselves,
and only allowing the moderator to unmute people.
@Broo2016 has many other useful suggestions for managing meetings.

## Making Decisions {#teams-martha}

The purpose of a well-run meeting is to make decisions,
so sooner or later,
the members of a project must decide who has a say in what.
The first step is to acknowledge that every team has a power structure:
the question is whether it's formal or informal---in other words,
whether it's accountable or unaccountable [@Free1972].
The latter can work for groups of up to half a dozen people
in which everyone knows everyone else.
Beyond that,
groups need to spell out
who has the authority to make which decisions
and how to achieve consensus.
In short,
they need explicit \gref{governance}{governance}.\index{governance!project}\index{project!governance}

\gref{Martha's Rules}{marthas_rules} are a practical way to do this\index{Martha's Rules}\index{governance!Martha's Rules}
in groups of up to a few dozen members [@Mina1986]:

1.  Before each meeting, anyone who wishes may sponsor a proposal.
    Proposals must be filed at least 24 hours before a meeting
    in order to be considered at that meeting, and must include:
    \newpage
    -   a one-line summary
    -   the full text of the proposal
    -   any required background information
    -   pros and cons
    -   possible alternatives

2.  A quorum is established in a meeting if half or more of voting members are present.

3.  Once a person has sponsored a proposal, they are responsible for it.
    The group may not discuss or vote on the issue unless the sponsor or their delegate is present.
    The sponsor is also responsible for presenting the item to the group.

4.  After the sponsor presents the proposal,
    a \gref{sense vote}{sense_vote} is cast for the proposal prior to any discussion:
    -   Who likes the proposal?
    -   Who can live with the proposal?
    -   Who is uncomfortable with the proposal?

5.  If all of the group likes or can live with the proposal,
    it passes with no further discussion.

6.  If most of the group is uncomfortable with the proposal,
    it is sent back to its sponsor for further work.
    (The sponsor may decide to drop it if it's clear that
    the majority isn't going to support it.)

7.  If some members are uncomfortable with the proposal,
    a timer is set for a brief discussion moderated by the meeting moderator.
    After 10 minutes or when no one has anything further to add,
    the moderator calls for a straight yes-or-no vote on the question:
    "Should we implement this decision over the stated objections?"
    If a majority votes "yes" the proposal is implemented.
    Otherwise, it is returned to the sponsor for further work.

Every group that uses Martha's Rules must make two procedural decisions:

How are proposals put forward?
:   In a software development project,
    the easiest way is to file an issue in the project's GitHub repository
    tagged *Proposal*,
    or to create a pull request containing a single file
    with the text of the proposal.
    Team members can then comment on the proposal,
    and the sponsor can revise it
    before bringing it to a vote.

Who gets to vote?
:   The usual answer is "whoever is working on the project,"
    but as it attracts more volunteer contributors,
    a more explicit rule is needed.
    One common method is for existing members to nominate new ones,
    who are then voted in (or not) using the process described above.

## Make All This Obvious to Newcomers {#teams-documentation}

Rules that people don't know about can't help them.
Once your team agrees on a project structure,
a workflow,
how to get items on a meeting agenda,
or how to make decisions,
you should therefore take the time to document this for newcomers.
This information may be included as sections in the existing `README` file\index{project files!README}
or put into files of their own:

-   `CONTRIBUTING`\index{project files!CONTRIBUTING}
    explains how to contribute,
    i.e.,
    what naming conventions to use for functions,
    what tags to put on issues (SectionÂ \@ref(teams-planning)),
    or how to install and configure the software needed to start work on the project.
    These instructions can also be included as a section in `README`;
    wherever they go,
    remember that the easier it is for people to get set up and contribute,
    the more likely they are to do so [@Stei2014].

-   `GOVERNANCE`\index{project files!GOVERNANCE}
    explains how the project is run (SectionÂ \@ref(teams-martha)).
    It is still uncommon for this to be in a file of its own---it is more often included
    in `README` or `CONTRIBUTING`---but open communities have learned the hard way
    that *not* being explicit about who has a voice in decisions
    and how contributors can tell what decisions have been made
    causes trouble sooner or later.

Having these files helps new contributors orient themselves,
and also signals that the project is well run.

## Handling Conflict {#teams-conflict}

You just missed an important deadline,
and people are unhappy.
The sick feeling in the pit of your stomach has turned to anger:
you did *your* part,
but Sylvie didn't finish her stuff until the very last minute,
which meant that no one else had time to spot the two big mistakes she'd made.
As for Cho,
he didn't deliver at all---again.
If something doesn't change,
contributors are going to start looking for a new project.

Conflicts like this come up all the time.\index{conflict!in teams}
Broadly speaking, there are four ways we can deal with them:

1.  Cross our fingers and hope that things will get better on their own,
    even though they didn't the last three times.

2.  Do extra work to make up for others' shortcomings.
    This saves us the mental anguish of confronting others in the short run,
    but the time for that "extra" has to come from somewhere.
    Sooner or later,
    our personal lives or other parts of the project will suffer.

3.  Lose our temper.
    People often wind up displacing anger into other parts of their life:
    they may yell at someone for taking an extra thirty seconds to make a change
    when what they really need to do is tell their boss
    that they won't work through another holiday weekend
    to make up for management's decision to short-staff the project.

4.  Take constructive steps to fix the underlying problem.

Most of us find the first three options easiest,
even though they don't actually fix the problem.
The fourth option is harder because we don't like confrontation.
If we manage it properly,
though,
it is a lot less bruising,
which means that we don't have to be as afraid of initiating it.
Also,
if people believe that we will take steps when they bully, lie, procrastinate, or do a half-assed job,
they will usually avoid making it necessary.

Make sure we are not guilty of the same sin.
:   We won't get very far complaining about someone else interrupting in meetings
    if we do it just as frequently.

Check expectations.
:   Are we sure the offender knows what standards they are supposed to be meeting?
    This is where things like job descriptions
    or up-front discussion of who's responsible for what
    come in handy.

Check the situation.
:   Is someone dealing with an ailing parent or immigration woes?
    Have they been put to work on three other projects that we don't know about?
    Use open questions like, "Can you help me understand this?" when checking in.
    This gives them the freedom to explain something you may not have expected,
    and avoids the pressure of being asked directly about something they don't want to explain.

Document the offense.
:   Write down what the offender has actually done and why it's not good enough.
    Doing this helps us clarify what we're upset about
    and is absolutely necessary if we have to escalate.

Check with other team members.
:   Are we alone in feeling that the offender is letting the team down?
    If so, we aren't necessarily wrong,
    but it'll be a lot easier to fix things if we have the support of the rest of the team.
    Finding out who else on the team is unhappy can be the hardest part of the whole process,
    since we can't even ask the question without letting on that we are upset
    and word will almost certainly get back to whoever we are asking about,
    who might then accuse us of stirring up trouble.

Talk with the offender.
:   This should be a team effort:
    put it on the agenda for a team meeting,
    present the complaint,
    and make sure that the offender understands it.
    Doing this once is often enough:
    if someone realizes that they're going to be called on their hitchhiking or bad manners,
    they will usually change their ways.

Escalate as soon as there's a second offense.
:   People who don't have good intentions
    count on us giving them one last chance after another
    until the project is finished and they can go suck the life out of their next victim.
    *Don't fall into this trap.*
    If someone stole a laptop, we would report it right away.
    If someone steals time,
    we are being foolish if we give them a chance to do it again and again.

In academic research projects,
"escalation" means "taking the issue to the project's principal investigator."
Of course,
the PI has probably had dozens of students complain to her over the years
about teammates not doing their share,
and it isn't uncommon to have both halves of a pair tell the supervisor that they're doing all the work.
(This is yet another reason to use version control:
it makes it easy to check who's actually written what.)
In order to get her to take us seriously and help us fix our problem,
we should send her an email signed by several people
that describes the problem and the steps we have already taken to resolve it.
Make sure the offender gets a copy as well,
and ask the supervisor to arrange a meeting to resolve the issue.

What can we do if conflict becomes more personal and heated,
especially if it relates to violations of our Code of Conduct?
A few simple guidelines will go a long way:

1.  Be short, simple, and firm.

2.  Don't try to be funny.
    It almost always backfires, or will later be used against us.

3.  Play for the audience.
    We probably won't change the person we are calling out,
    but we might change the minds or strengthen the resolve of people who are observing.

4.  Pick our battles.
    We can't challenge everyone, every time,
    without exhausting ourselves and deafening our audience.
    An occasional sharp retort will be much more effective than constant criticism.

5.  Don't shame or insult one group when trying to help another.
    For example,
    don't call someone stupid
    when what we really mean is that they're racist or homophobic.

[Captain Awkward][captain-awkward] has useful advice for discussions like these,
and [Charles' Rules of Argument][charles-rules] are very useful online.

Finally,
it's important to recognize that good principles sometimes conflict.
For example,
consider this scenario:

> A manager consistently uses male pronouns to refer to software and people of unknown gender.
> When you tell them it makes you uncomfortable to treat maleness as the norm,
> they say that male is the default gender in their first language
> and you should be more considerate of people from other cultures.

On the one hand,
we want to respect other people's cultures;
on the other hand,
we want to be inclusive of women.
In this case,
the manager's discomfort about changing pronouns
matters less than the career harm caused by them being exclusionary,
but many cases are not this clear cut.

## Summary {#teams-summary}

This chapter was the hardest in this book to write,
but is probably also the most important.
A project can survive bad code or stumbles with Git,
but not confusion and interpersonal conflict.
Collaboration and management become easier with practice,
and everything you learn from taking part in research software projects
will help other things you do as well.

## Exercises {#teams-exercises}

### Finding information {#teams-ex-scavenger-hunt}

Take a look at [the GitHub repository for this book][book-repo].
Where is the information for licensing and contributing?

### Add a Code of Conduct to your project {#teams-ex-boilerplate-coc}

Add a `CONDUCT.md` file to your Zipf's Law project repository.
Use the [Contributor Covenant][covenant] Code of Conduct template and modify the
places that need updating (e.g., who to contact).
Be sure to edit the contact information in both before committing the files.

### Add a license to your project {#teams-ex-boilerplate-license}

Add either an MIT or a GPL `LICENSE.md` file to your Zipf's Law project
repository.
Modify the contents to include your full name and year.

### Adding contribution guidelines {#teams-ex-contributing}

1.  Add a section to the `README.md` file in the Zipf's Law project
    to tell people where to find out more about contributing.

2.  Add a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the Zipf's Law project
    to describe how other people can contribute to it.

Be sure to add it to the root directory of your Git repository,
so that when someone opens a pull request or creates an issue on GitHub,
they will be presented with a link to the CONTRIBUTING file
(see the [GitHub contributors guide][github-contributors-guide] for details).

### File an issue {#teams-ex-file-issue}

Create a feature request issue in your Zipf's Law project repository
to ask that unit tests be written for `countwords.py`
(we will do this in Chapter \@ref(testing)).

### Label issues {#teams-ex-label}

1.  Create the labels *current* and *discussion*
    to help organize and prioritize your issues.
2.  Delete at least one of the labels that GitHub automatically created for you.
3.  Apply at least one label to each issue in your repository.

### Balancing individual and team needs {#teams-ex-balancing}

A new member of your team has a medically diagnosed attention disorder.
In order to help themselves focus,
they need to talk to themselves while coding.
Several other members of your team have come to you privately
to say that they find this distracting.
What steps would you take?

### Crediting invisible contributions {#teams-ex-invisible}

Your team has a rule:
if someone's name appears in the Git history for a project,
they are listed as a co-author on papers for that project.
A new member of your team has complained that this is unfair:
people who haven't contributed for over two years are still being included as authors,
while they aren't included because the many hours they have spent doing code
reviews don't show up in the Git history.
How would you address this issue?

### Who are you? {#teams-ex-members}

Which (if any) of the following profiles describes you best?
How would you help each of these people if they were on your team?

-   *Anna* thinks she knows more about every subject
    than everyone else on the team put together.
    No matter what you say, she'll correct you;
    no matter what you know, she knows better.
    If you keep track in team meetings of how often people interrupt one another,
    her score is usually higher than everyone else's put together.

-   *Bao* is a contrarian:
    no matter what anyone says, he'll take the opposite side.
    This is healthy in small doses,
    but when Bao does it,
    there's always another objection lurking behind the first half dozen.

-   *Frank* believes that knowledge is power.
    He enjoys knowing things that other people don't---or to be more accurate,
    he enjoys it when people know he knows things they don't.
    Frank can actually make things work,
    but when asked how he did it,
    he'll grin and say,
    "Oh, I'm sure you can figure it out."

-   *Hediyeh* is quiet.
    Very quiet.
    She never speaks up in meetings,
    even when she knows that what other people are saying is wrong.
    She might contribute to the mailing list,
    but she's very sensitive to criticism,
    and will always back down rather than defending her point of view.

-   *Kenny* is a hitchhiker.
    He has discovered that most people would rather shoulder some extra work than snitch,
    and he takes advantage of it at every turn.
    The frustrating thing is that he's so damn *plausible*
    when someone finally does confront him.
    "There have been mistakes on all sides," he says,
    or,
    "Well, I think you're nit-picking."

-   *Melissa* would easily have made the varsity procrastination team
    if she'd bothered to show up to tryouts.
    She means well---she really does feel bad about letting people down---but
    somehow her tasks are never finished until the last possible moment.
    Of course, that means that everyone who is depending on her can't do their work until
    *after* the last possible moment.

-   *Petra*'s favorite phrase is "why don't we."
    Why don't we write a GUI to help people edit the program's configuration files?
    Hey, why don't we invent our own little language for designing GUIs?

-   *Raj* is rude.
    "It's just the way I talk," he says.
    "If you can't hack it, maybe you should find another team."
    His favorite phrase is, "That's stupid,"
    and he uses obscenity in every second sentence.

## Key Points {#teams-keypoints}


-   Welcome and nurture community members proactively.
-   Create an explicit Code of Conduct for your project modeled on the [Contributor Covenant][covenant].
-   Include a license in your project so that it's clear who can do what with the material.
-   Create \gref{issues}{issue} for bugs, enhancement requests, and discussions.
-   \gref{Label issues}{issue_label} to identify their purpose.
-   \gref{Triage}{triage} issues regularly and group them into \gref{milestones}{milestone} to track progress.
-   Include contribution guidelines in your project that specify its workflow and its expectations of participants.
-   Make rules about \gref{governance}{governance} explicit.
-   Use common-sense rules to make project meetings fair and productive.
-   Manage conflict between participants rather than hoping it will take care of itself.

# Automating Analyses with Make {#automate}

It's easy to run one program to process a single data file,
but what happens when our analysis depends on many files,
or when we need to re-do the analysis every time new data arrives?
What should we do if the analysis has several steps
that we have to do in a particular order?

If we try to keep track of this ourselves,
we will inevitably forget some crucial steps
and it will be hard for other people to pick up our work.
Instead,
we should use a \gref{build manager}{build_manager}\index{build manager}
to keep track of what depends on what
and run our analysis programs automatically.
These tools were invented to help programmers compile complex software,
but can be used to automate any workflow.

Our Zipf's Law project currently includes these files:

```text
zipf/
âââ .gitignore
âââ CONDUCT.md
âââ CONTRIBUTING.md
âââ LICENSE.md
âââ README.md
âââ bin
âÂ Â  âââ book_summary.sh
âÂ Â  âââ collate.py
âÂ Â  âââ countwords.py
âÂ Â  âââ plotcounts.py
â   âââ script_template.py
âÂ Â  âââ utilities.py
âââ data
â   âââ README.md
â   âââ dracula.txt
â   âââ frankenstein.txt
â   âââ ...
âââ results
    âââ dracula.csv
    âââ dracula.png
    âââ ...
```

Now that the project's main building blocks are in place,
we're ready to automate our analysis using a build manager.
We will use a program called [Make][gnu-make]\index{Make} to do this
so that every time we add a new book to our data,
we can create a new plot of the word count distribution with a single command.
Make works as follows:

1.  Every time the \gref{operating system}{operating_system} creates, reads, or changes a file,
    it updates a \gref{timestamp}{timestamp}\index{timestamp} on the file to show when the operation took place.
    Make can compare these timestamps
    to figure out whether files are newer or older than one another.

2.  A user can describe which files depend on each other
    by writing \gref{rules}{build_rule}\index{build rule} in a \gref{Makefile}{makefile}.
    For example,
    one rule could say that `results/moby_dick.csv` depends on `data/moby_dick.txt`,
    while another could say that the plot `results/comparison.png`
    depends on all of the CSV files in the `results` directory.

3.  Each rule also tells Make how to update an out-of-date file.
    For example,
    the rule for *Moby Dick* could tell Make to run `bin/countwords.py`
    if the result file is older than either the raw data file or the program.

4.  When the user runs Make,
    the program checks all of the rules in the Makefile
    and runs the commands needed to update any that are out of date.
    If there are \gref{transitive dependencies}{transitive_dependency}---i.e.,\index{build dependency}\index{dependency!in build}
    if A depends on B and B depends on C---then Make will trace them through
    and run all of the commands it needs to in the right order.

This chapter uses a version of Make called [GNU Make][gnu-make].
It comes with MacOS and Linux;
please see SectionÂ \@ref(getting-started-install-software) for Windows installation instructions.

## Updating a Single File {#automate-single-file}

To start automating our analysis,
let's create a file called `Makefile` in the root of our project
and add the following:

```makefile
# Regenerate results for "Moby Dick"
results/moby_dick.csv : data/moby_dick.txt
	python bin/countwords.py \
		data/moby_dick.txt > results/moby_dick.csv
```

As in the shell and many other programming languages,
`#` indicates that the first line is a comment.
The second and third lines form a \gref{build rule}{build_rule}:\index{build rule}
the \gref{target}{build_target}\index{build target} of the rule is `results/moby_dick.csv`,
its single \gref{prerequisite}{prerequisite} is the file `data/moby_dick.txt`,
and the two are separated by a single colon `:`.
There is no limit on the length of statement lines in Makefiles,
but to aid readability we have used a backslash (`\`) character to split
the lengthy third line in this example.

The target and prerequisite tell Make what depends on what.
The line below them describes the \gref{recipe}{build_recipe}\index{build recipe}
that will update the target if it is out of date.
The recipe consists of one or more shell commands,
each of which *must* be prefixed by a single tab character.
Spaces cannot be used instead of tabs here,
which can be confusing as they are interchangeable in most other programming languages.
In the rule above,
the recipe is "run `bin/countwords.py` on the raw data file
and put the output in a CSV file in the `results` directory."

To test our rule, run this command in the shell:

```bash
$ make
```

Make automatically looks for a file called `Makefile`,
follows the rules it contains,
and prints the commands that were executed.
In this case it displays:

```text
python bin/countwords.py \
  data/moby_dick.txt > results/moby_dick.csv
```

> **Indentation Errors**
>
> If a `Makefile` indents a rule with spaces rather than tabs,
> Make produces an error message like this:
>
> ```text
> Makefile:3: *** missing separator.  Stop.
> ```

When Make follows the rules in our Makefile,
one of three things will happen:

1.  If `results/moby_dick.csv` doesn't exist,
    Make runs the recipe to create it.
2.  If `data/moby_dick.txt` is newer than `results/moby_dick.csv`,
    Make runs the recipe to update the results.
3.  If `results/moby_dick.csv` is newer than its prerequisite,
    Make does nothing.

In the first two cases,
Make prints the commands it runs,
along with anything those commands print to the screen
via \gref{standard output}{stdout} or \gref{standard error}{stderr}.
There is no screen output in this case,
so we only see the command.

No matter what happened the first time we ran `make`,
if we run it again right away it does nothing
because our rule's target is now up to date.
It tells us this by displaying the message:

```text
make: `results/moby_dick.csv' is up to date.
```

We can check that it is telling the truth by listing the files with their timestamps,
ordered by how recently they have been updated:

```bash
$ ls -l -t data/moby_dick.txt results/moby_dick.csv
```

```text
-rw-r--r-- 1 amira staff  274967 Nov 29 12:58
  results/moby_dick.csv
-rw-r--r-- 1 amira staff 1253891 Nov 27 20:56
  data/moby_dick.txt
```

\newpage

As a further test:

1.  Delete `results/moby_dick.csv` and run `make` again.
    This is case #1, so Make runs the recipe.
2.  Use `touch data/moby_dick.txt` to update the timestamp on the data file,
    then run `make`.
    This is case #2,
    so again,
    Make runs the recipe.

> **Managing Makefiles**
>
> We don't have to call our file `Makefile`:
> if we prefer something like `workflows.mk`,
> we can tell Make to read recipes from that file using
> `make -f workflows.mk`.

## Managing Multiple Files {#automate-multiple}

Our Makefile documents exactly how to reproduce one specific result.
Let's add another rule to reproduce another result:

```makefile
# Regenerate results for "Moby Dick"
results/moby_dick.csv : data/moby_dick.txt
	python bin/countwords.py \
		data/moby_dick.txt > results/moby_dick.csv

# Regenerate results for "Jane Eyre"
results/jane_eyre.csv : data/jane_eyre.txt
	python bin/countwords.py \
		data/jane_eyre.txt > results/jane_eyre.csv
```

When we run `make` it tells us:

```text
make: `results/moby_dick.csv' is up to date.
```

By default, Make only attempts to update the first target it finds in the Makefile,
which is called the \gref{default target}{default_target}.\index{build target!default}
In this case,
the first target is `results/moby_dick.csv`,
which is already up to date.
To update something else,
we need to tell Make specifically what we want:

```bash
$ make results/jane_eyre.csv
```

```text
python bin/countwords.py \
  data/jane_eyre.txt > results/jane_eyre.csv
```

If we have to run `make` once for each result,
we're right back where we started.
However,
we can add a rule to our Makefile to update all of our results at once.
We do this by creating a \gref{phony target}{phony_target}\index{build target!phony}
that doesn't correspond to an actual file.
Let's add this line to the top of our Makefile:

```makefile
# Regenerate all results.
all : results/moby_dick.csv results/jane_eyre.csv
```

There is no file called `all`,
and this rule doesn't have any recipes of its own,
but when we run `make all`,
Make finds everything that `all` depends on,
then brings each of those prerequisites up to date (FigureÂ \@ref(fig:automate-all)).

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/automate/make-dependency-graph.png" alt="Dependency graph when making everything." width="60%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:automate-all)Dependency graph when making everything.</p>
</div>

The order in which rules appear in the Makefile
does not necessarily determine the order in which recipes are run.
Make is free to run commands in any order
so long as nothing is updated before its prerequisites are up to date.

We can use phony targets to automate and document other steps in our workflow.
For example,
let's add another target to our Makefile to delete all of the result files we have generated
so that we can start afresh.
By convention this target is called `clean`,\index{build target!clean}
and we'll place it below the two existing targets:

```makefile
# Remove all generated files.
clean :
	rm -f results/*.csv
```

The `-f` flag to `rm` means "force removal":
if it is present,
`rm` won't complain if the files we have told it to remove are already gone.
If we now run:

```bash
$ make clean
```

Make will delete any results files we have.
This is a lot safer than typing `rm -f results/*.csv` at the command line each time,
because if we mistakenly put a space before the `*`
we would delete all of the CSV files in the project's root directory.

Phony targets are very useful,
but there is a catch.
Try doing this:

```bash
$ mkdir clean
$ make clean
```

```text
make: `clean' is up to date.
```

Since there is a directory called `clean`,
Make thinks the target `clean` in the Makefile refers to this directory.
Since the rule has no prerequisites,
it can't be out of date,
so no recipes are executed.

We can unconfuse Make by putting this line at the top of Makefile
to explicitly state which targets are phony:

```makefile
.PHONY : all clean
```

## Updating Files When Programs Change {#automate-depend-programs}

Our current Makefile says that each result file depends on the corresponding data file.
That's not entirely true:
each result also depends on the program used to generate it.
If we change our program,
we should regenerate our results.
To get Make to do that,
we can change our prerequisites to include the program:

```makefile
# Regenerate results for "Moby Dick"
results/moby_dick.csv : data/moby_dick.txt bin/countwords.py
	python bin/countwords.py \
    	data/moby_dick.txt > results/moby_dick.csv

# Regenerate results for "Jane Eyre"
results/jane_eyre.csv : data/jane_eyre.txt bin/countwords.py
	python bin/countwords.py \
		data/jane_eyre.txt > results/jane_eyre.csv
```

To run both of these rules,
we can type `make all`.
Alternatively,
since `all` is the first target in our Makefile,
Make will use it if we just type `make` on its own:

```bash
$ touch bin/countwords.py
$ make
```

```text
python bin/countwords.py \
  data/moby_dick.txt > results/moby_dick.csv
python bin/countwords.py \
  data/jane_eyre.txt > results/jane_eyre.csv
```

The exercises will explore how we can write a rule
to tell us whether our results will be different
after a change to a program
without actually updating them.
Rules like this can help us test our programs:
if we don't think an addition or modification ought to affect the results,
but it would,
we may have some debugging to do.

## Reducing Repetition in a Makefile {#automate-variables}

Our Makefile now mentions `bin/countwords.py` four times.
If we ever change the name of the program or move it to a different location,
we will have to find and replace each of those occurrences.
More importantly,
this redundancy makes our Makefile harder to understand,
just as scattering \gref{magic numbers}{magic_number} through programs
makes them harder to understand.

\newpage

The solution is the same one we use in programs:
define and use variables.
Let's modify the results regeneration code by 
creating targets for the word-counting script and the command used to run it.
The entire file should now read:

```makefile
.PHONY : all clean

COUNT=bin/countwords.py
RUN_COUNT=python $(COUNT)

# Regenerate all results.
all : results/moby_dick.csv results/jane_eyre.csv

# Regenerate results for "Moby Dick"
results/moby_dick.csv : data/moby_dick.txt $(COUNT)
	$(RUN_COUNT) data/moby_dick.txt > results/moby_dick.csv

# Regenerate results for "Jane Eyre"
results/jane_eyre.csv : data/jane_eyre.txt $(COUNT)
	$(RUN_COUNT) data/jane_eyre.txt > results/jane_eyre.csv

# Remove all generated files.
clean :
	rm -f results/*.csv
```

Each definition takes the form `NAME=value`.
Variables are written in upper case by convention
so that they'll stand out from filenames
(which are usually in lower case),
but Make doesn't require this.
What *is* required is using parentheses to refer to the variable,
i.e.,
to use `$(NAME)` and not `$NAME`.

> **Why the Parentheses?**
>
> For historical reasons,
> Make interprets `$NAME` to be a variable called `N` followed by the three characters "AME".
> If no variable called `N` exists,
> `$NAME` becomes `AME`,
> which is almost certainly not what we want.

As in programs,
variables don't just cut down on typing.
They also tell readers that several things are always and exactly the same,
which reduces \gref{cognitive load}{cognitive_load}.

## Automatic Variables {#automate-autovar}

We could add a third rule to analyze a third novel and a fourth to analyze a fourth,
but that won't scale to hundreds or thousands of novels.
Instead,
we can write a generic rule that does what we want for every one of our data files.

To do this,
we need to understand Make's
\gref{automatic variables}{automatic_variable}.\index{automatic variables (in Make)}\index{Make!automatic variables}
The first step is to use the very cryptic expression `$@` in the rule's recipe
to mean "the target of the rule."
It lets us turn this:

```makefile
# Regenerate results for "Moby Dick"
results/moby_dick.csv : data/moby_dick.txt $(COUNT)
	$(RUN_COUNT) data/moby_dick.txt > results/moby_dick.csv
```

into this:

```makefile
# Regenerate results for "Moby Dick"
results/moby_dick.csv : data/moby_dick.txt $(COUNT)
	$(RUN_COUNT) data/moby_dick.txt > $@
```

Make defines a value of `$@` separately for each rule,
so it always refers to that rule's target.
And yes,
`$@` is an unfortunate name:
something like `$TARGET` would have been easier to understand,
but we're stuck with it now.

The next step is to replace the explicit list of prerequisites in the recipe
with the automatic variable `$^`,
which means "all the prerequisites in the rule":

```makefile
# Regenerate results for "Moby Dick"
results/moby_dick.csv : data/moby_dick.txt $(COUNT)
	$(RUN_COUNT) $^ > $@
```

However,
this doesn't work.
The rule's prerequisites are the novel and the word-counting program.
When Make expands the recipe,
the resulting command tries to process the program `bin/countwords.py`
as if it was a data file:

```bash
python bin/countwords.py data/moby_dick.txt bin/countwords.py >
  results/moby_dick.csv
```

Make solves this problem with another automatic variable `$<`,
which means "only the first prerequisite".
Using it lets us rewrite our rule as:

```makefile
# Regenerate results for "Moby Dick"
results/moby_dick.csv : data/moby_dick.txt $(COUNT)
	$(RUN_COUNT) $< > $@
```

If you use this approach,
the rule for *Jane Eyre* should be updated as well.
The next section,
however,
includes instructions for generalizing rules.

## Generic Rules {#automate-pattern}

`$< > $@` is even harder to read than `$@` on its own,
but we can now replace all the rules for generating results files
with one \gref{pattern rule}{pattern_rule}\index{pattern rule}
using the \gref{wildcard}{wildcard}\index{wildcard!in Make} `%`,
which matches zero or more characters in a filename.
Whatever matches `%` in the target also matches in the prerequisites,
so the rule:

```makefile
results/%.csv : data/%.txt $(COUNT)
	$(RUN_COUNT) $< > $@
```

will handle *Jane Eyre*, *Moby Dick*, *The Time Machine*, and every other novel in the `data/` directory.
`%` cannot be used in recipes,
which is why `$<` and `$@` are needed.

With this rule in place, our entire Makefile is reduced to:

```makefile
.PHONY: all clean

COUNT=bin/countwords.py
RUN_COUNT=python $(COUNT)

# Regenerate all results.
all : results/moby_dick.csv results/jane_eyre.csv \
  results/time_machine.csv

# Regenerate result for any book.
results/%.csv : data/%.txt $(COUNT)
	$(RUN_COUNT) $< > $@

# Remove all generated files.
clean :
	rm -f results/*.csv
```

We now have fewer lines of text,
but we've also included a third book.
To test our shortened Makefile,
let's delete all of the results files:

```bash
$ make clean
```

```text
rm -f results/*.csv
```

and then re-create them:

```bash
$ make  # Same as `make all` as "all" is the first target
```

```text
python bin/countwords.py data/moby_dick.txt >
  results/moby_dick.csv
python bin/countwords.py data/jane_eyre.txt >
  results/jane_eyre.csv
python bin/countwords.py data/time_machine.txt >
  results/time_machine.csv
```

We can still rebuild individual files if we want,
since Make will take the target filename we give on the command line
and see if a pattern rule matches it:

```bash
$ touch data/jane_eyre.txt
$ make results/jane_eyre.csv
```

```text
python bin/countwords.py data/jane_eyre.txt >
  results/jane_eyre.csv
```

## Defining Sets of Files {#automate-functions}

Our analysis is still not fully automated:
if we add another book to `data`,
we have to remember to add its name to the `all` target in the Makefile as well.
Once again we will fix this in steps.

To start,
imagine that all the results files already exist
and we just want to update them.
We can define a variable called `RESULTS`
to be a list of all the results files
using the same wildcards we would use in the shell:

```makefile
RESULTS=results/*.csv
```

We can then rewrite `all` to depend on that list:

```makefile
# Regenerate all results.
all : $(RESULTS)
```

However,
this only works if the results files already exist.
If one doesn't,
its name won't be included in `RESULTS`
and Make won't realize that we want to generate it.

What we really want is to generate the list of results files
based on the list of books in the `data/` directory.
We can create that list using Make's `wildcard` function:\index{functions (in Make)}

```makefile
DATA=$(wildcard data/*.txt)
```

This calls the function `wildcard` with the argument `data/*.txt`.
The result is a list of all the text files in the `data` directory,
just as we would get with `data/*.txt` in the shell.
The syntax is odd because functions were added to Make long after it was first written,
but at least they have readable names.

To check that this line does the right thing,
we can add another phony target called `settings`
that uses the shell command `echo` to print the names and values of our variables:

```makefile
.PHONY: all clean settings

# ...everything else...

# Show variables' values.
settings :
	echo COUNT: $(COUNT)
	echo DATA: $(DATA)
```

Let's run this:

```bash
$ make settings
```

```text
echo COUNT: bin/countwords.py
COUNT: bin/countwords.py
echo DATA: data/dracula.txt data/frankenstein.txt
  data/jane_eyre.txt data/moby_dick.txt
  data/sense_and_sensibility.txt
  data/sherlock_holmes.txt data/time_machine.txt
DATA: data/dracula.txt data/frankenstein.txt
  data/jane_eyre.txt data/moby_dick.txt
  data/sense_and_sensibility.txt data/sherlock_holmes.txt
  data/time_machine.txt
```

The output appears twice
because Make shows us the command it's going to run before running it.
Putting `@` before the command in the recipe prevents this,
which makes the output easier to read:

```makefile
settings :
	@echo COUNT: $(COUNT)
	@echo DATA: $(DATA)
```

```bash
$ make settings
```

```text
COUNT: bin/countwords.py
DATA: data/dracula.txt data/frankenstein.txt
  data/jane_eyre.txt data/moby_dick.txt
  data/sense_and_sensibility.txt data/sherlock_holmes.txt
  data/time_machine.txt

```

We now have the names of our input files.
To create a list of corresponding output files,
we use Make's `patsubst` function
(short for **pat**tern **subst**itution):

```makefile
RESULTS=$(patsubst data/%.txt,results/%.csv,$(DATA))
```

The first argument to `patsubst` is the pattern to look for,
which in this case is a text file in the `data` directory.
We use `%` to match the \gref{stem}{filename_stem}\index{filename stem}\index{stem (of filename)} of the file's name,
which is the part we want to keep.

The second argument is the replacement we want.
As in a pattern rule,
Make replaces `%` in this argument with whatever matched `%` in the pattern,
which creates the name of the result file we want.
Finally,
the third argument is what to do the substitution in,
which is our list of books' names.

Let's check the `RESULTS` variable by adding another command to the `settings` target:

```makefile
settings :
	@echo COUNT: $(COUNT)
	@echo DATA: $(DATA)
	@echo RESULTS: $(RESULTS)
```

```bash
$ make settings
```

```text
COUNT: bin/countwords.py
DATA: data/dracula.txt data/frankenstein.txt data/jane_eyre.txt
  data/moby_dick.txt data/sense_and_sensibility.txt
  data/sherlock_holmes.txt data/time_machine.txt
RESULTS: results/dracula.csv results/frankenstein.csv
  results/jane_eyre.csv results/moby_dick.csv
  results/sense_and_sensibility.csv
  results/sherlock_holmes.csv results/time_machine.csv
```

Excellent:
`DATA` has the names of the files we want to process
and `RESULTS` automatically has the names of the corresponding result files.

Why haven't we included `RUN_COUNT` when assessing our variables' values?
This is another place we can streamline our script,
by removing `RUN_COUNT` from the list of variables 
and changing our regeneration rule:

```makefile
# Regenerate result for any book.
results/%.csv : data/%.txt $(COUNT)
	python $(COUNT) $< > $@
```

Since the phony target `all` depends on `$(RESULTS)`
(i.e., all the files whose names appear in the variable `RESULTS`)
we can regenerate all the results in one step:

```bash
$ make clean
```

```text
rm -f results/*.csv
```

```bash
$ make  # Same as `make all` since "all" is the first target
```

```text
python bin/countwords.py data/dracula.txt > results/dracula.csv
python bin/countwords.py data/frankenstein.txt >
  results/frankenstein.csv
python bin/countwords.py data/jane_eyre.txt >
  results/jane_eyre.csv
python bin/countwords.py data/moby_dick.txt >
  results/moby_dick.csv
python bin/countwords.py data/sense_and_sensibility.txt >
  results/sense_and_sensibility.csv
python bin/countwords.py data/sherlock_holmes.txt >
  results/sherlock_holmes.csv
python bin/countwords.py data/time_machine.txt >
  results/time_machine.csv
```

Our workflow is now just two steps:
add a data file and run Make.
This is a big improvement over running things manually,
particularly as we start to add more steps like merging data files and generating plots.

## Documenting a Makefile {#automate-doc}

Every well-behaved program should tell people how to use it [@Tasc2017].
If we run `make --help`,
we get a (very) long list of options that Make understands,
but nothing about our specific workflow.
We could create another phony target called `help` that prints a list of available commands:

```makefile
.PHONY: all clean help settings

# ...other definitions...

# Show help.
help :
	@echo "all : regenerate all results."
	@echo "results/*.csv : regenerate result for any book."
	@echo "clean : remove all generated files."
	@echo "settings : show variables' values."
	@echo "help : show this message."
```

but sooner or later
we will add a target or rule and forget to update this list.

A better approach is to format some comments in a special way
and then extract and display those comments when asked to.
We'll use `##` (a double comment marker) to indicate the lines we want displayed
and `grep` (SectionÂ \@ref(bash-advanced-find)) to pull these lines out of the file:

```makefile
.PHONY: all clean help settings

COUNT=bin/countwords.py
DATA=$(wildcard data/*.txt)
RESULTS=$(patsubst data/%.txt,results/%.csv,$(DATA))

## all : regenerate all results.
all : $(RESULTS)

## results/%.csv : regenerate result for any book.
results/%.csv : data/%.txt $(COUNT)
	python $(COUNT) $< > $@

## clean : remove all generated files.
clean :
	rm -f results/*.csv

## settings : show variables' values.
settings :
	@echo COUNT: $(COUNT)
	@echo DATA: $(DATA)
	@echo RESULTS: $(RESULTS)

## help : show this message.
help :
	@grep '^##' ./Makefile
```

Let's test:

```bash
$ make help
```

```text
## all : regenerate all results.
## results/%.csv : regenerate result for any book.
## clean : remove all generated files.
## settings : show variables' values.
## help : show this message.
```

The exercises will explore how to format this more readably.

## Automating Entire Analyses {#automate-pipeline}

To finish our discussion of Make,
let's automatically generate a collated list of word frequencies.
The target is a file called `results/collated.csv`
that depends on the results generated by `countwords.py`.
To create it,
we add or change these lines in our Makefile:

```makefile
# ...phony targets and previous variable definitions...

COLLATE=bin/collate.py

## all : regenerate all results.
all : results/collated.csv

## results/collated.csv : collate all results.
results/collated.csv : $(RESULTS) $(COLLATE)
	mkdir -p results
	python $(COLLATE) $(RESULTS) > $@

# ...other rules...

## settings : show variables' values.
settings :
	@echo COUNT: $(COUNT)
	@echo DATA: $(DATA)
	@echo RESULTS: $(RESULTS)
	@echo COLLATE: $(COLLATE)

# ...help rule...
```

The first two lines tell Make about the collation program,
while the change to `all` tells it what the final target of our pipeline is.
Since this target depends on the results files for single novels,
`make all` will regenerate all of those automatically.

The rule to regenerate `results/collated.csv` should look familiar by now:
it tells Make that all of the individual results have to be up-to-date
and that the final result should be regenerated if the program used to create it has changed.
One difference between the recipe in this rule and the recipes we've seen before
is that this recipe uses `$(RESULTS)` directly instead of an automatic variable.
We have written the rule this way because
there isn't an automatic variable that means "all but the last prerequisite,"
so there's no way to use automatic variables that wouldn't result in us trying to process our program.

Likewise,
we can also add the `plotcounts.py` script to this workflow
and update the `all` and `settings` rules accordingly.
Note that there is no `>` needed before the `$@`
because the default action of `plotcounts.py` is to write to a file
rather than to standard output.

```makefile
# ...phony targets and previous variable definitions...

PLOT=bin/plotcounts.py

## all : regenerate all results.
all : results/collated.png

## results/collated.png: plot the collated results.
results/collated.png : results/collated.csv
	python $(PLOT) $< --outfile $@

# ...other rules...

## settings : show variables' values.
settings :
	@echo COUNT: $(COUNT)
	@echo DATA: $(DATA)
	@echo RESULTS: $(RESULTS)
	@echo COLLATE: $(COLLATE)
	@echo PLOT: $(PLOT)

# ...help...
```

Running `make all` should now generate the new `collated.png` plot (FigureÂ \@ref(fig:automate-collated)):

```bash
$ make all
```

```text
python bin/collate.py results/time_machine.csv
  results/moby_dick.csv results/jane_eyre.csv
  results/dracula.csv results/sense_and_sensibility.csv
  results/sherlock_holmes.csv results/frankenstein.csv >
  results/collated.csv
python bin/plotcounts.py results/collated.csv --outfile
  results/collated.png
alpha: 1.1712445413685917
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/automate/collated.png" alt="Word count distribution for all books combined." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:automate-collated)Word count distribution for all books combined.</p>
</div>

\newpage

Finally,
we can update the `clean` target
to only remove files created by the Makefile.
It is a good habit to do this rather than using the asterisk wildcard to remove all files,
since you might manually place files in the results directory
and forget that these will be cleaned up when you run `make clean`.

```makefile
# ...phony targets and previous variable definitions...

## clean : remove all generated files.
clean :
	rm $(RESULTS) results/collated.csv results/collated.png
```

## Summary {#automate-summary}

Make's reliance on shell commands instead of direct calls to functions in Python sometimes makes it clumsy to use.
However,
that also makes it very flexible:
a single Makefile can run shell commands and programs written in a variety of languages,
which makes it a great way to assemble pipelines out of whatever is lying around.

Programmers have created many replacements for Make in the 45 years since it was first created---so many,
in fact,
that none have attracted enough users to displace it.
If you would like to explore them,
check out [Snakemake][snakemake] (for Python).
If you want to go deeper,
@Smit2011 describes the design and implementation of several build managers.

## Exercises {#automate-exercises}

Our `Makefile` currently reads as follows:

```makefile
.PHONY: all clean help settings

COUNT=bin/countwords.py
COLLATE=bin/collate.py
PLOT=bin/plotcounts.py
DATA=$(wildcard data/*.txt)
RESULTS=$(patsubst data/%.txt,results/%.csv,$(DATA))

## all : regenerate all results.
all : results/collated.png

## results/collated.png: plot the collated results.
results/collated.png : results/collated.csv
	python $(PLOT) $< --outfile $@

## results/collated.csv : collate all results.
results/collated.csv : $(RESULTS) $(COLLATE)
	@mkdir -p results
	python $(COLLATE) $(RESULTS) > $@

## results/%.csv : regenerate result for any book.
results/%.csv : data/%.txt $(COUNT)
	python $(COUNT) $< > $@

## clean : remove all generated files.
clean :
	rm $(RESULTS) results/collated.csv results/collated.png

## settings : show variables' values.
settings :
	@echo COUNT: $(COUNT)
	@echo DATA: $(DATA)
	@echo RESULTS: $(RESULTS)
	@echo COLLATE: $(COLLATE)
	@echo PLOT: $(PLOT)

## help : show this message.
help :
	@grep '^##' ./Makefile
```

A number of the exercises below ask you to make further edits to `Makefile`.

### Report results that would change {#automate-ex-report-change}

How can you get `make` to show the commands it would run
without actually running them?
(Hint: look at the manual page.)

### Useful options {#automate-ex-useful-options}

1.  What does Make's `-B` option do and when is it useful?
1.  What about the `-C` option?
1.  What about the `-f` option?

### Make sure the output directory exists {#automate-ex-mkdir}

One of our \gref{build recipes}{build_recipe} includes `mkdir -p`.
What does this do and why is it useful?

### Print the title and author {#automate-ex-print}

The build rule for regenerating the result for any book is currently:
```makefile
## results/%.csv : regenerate result for any book.
results/%.csv : data/%.txt $(COUNT)
	python $(COUNT) $< > $@
```

Add an extra line to the recipe that uses the `book_summary.sh` script
to print the title and author of the book to the screen.
Use `@bash` so that the command itself isn't printed to the screen
and don't forget to update the settings build rule to include the `book_summary.sh` script.

If you've successfully made those changes,
you should get the following output for *Dracula*:

```bash
$ make -B results/dracula.csv
```

```text
Title: Dracula
Author: Bram Stoker
python bin/countwords.py data/dracula.txt > results/dracula.csv
```

### Create all results {#automate-ex-all-results}

The default target of our final `Makefile` re-creates `results/collated.csv`.
Add a target to `Makefile`
so that `make results` creates or updates any result files that are missing or out of date,
but does *not* regenerate `results/collated.csv`.

### The perils of shell wildcards {#automate-ex-wildcard-perils}

What is wrong with writing the rule for `results/collated.csv` like this:

```makefile
results/collated.csv : results/*.csv
	python $(COLLATE) $^ > $@
```

(The fact that the result no longer depends on the program used to create it
isn't the biggest problem.)

### Making documentation more readable {#automate-ex-readable-docs}

We can format the documentation in our Makefile more readably using this command:

```makefile
## help : show all commands.
help :
	@grep -h -E '^##' ${MAKEFILE_LIST} | sed -e 's/## //g' \
	| column -t -s ':'
```

Using `man` and online search,
explain what every part of this recipe does.

### Configuration {#automate-ex-configuration}

A next step in automating this analysis might include 
moving the definitions of the `COUNT`, `COLLATE`, and `PLOT` variables
into a separate file called `config.mk`:

```makefile
COUNT=bin/countwords.py
COLLATE=bin/collate.py
PLOT=bin/plotcounts.py
```

and using the `include` command to access those definitions in the existing `Makefile`:

```makefile
.PHONY: results all clean help settings

include config.mk

# ... the rest of the Makefile ...
```

Under what circumstances would this strategy be useful?

## Key Points {#automate-keypoints}


-   [Make][gnu-make] is a widely used build manager.
-   A \gref{build manager}{build_manager} re-runs commands to update files that are out of date.
-   A \gref{build rule}{build_rule} has \gref{targets}{build_target}, \gref{prerequisites}{prerequisite}, and a \gref{recipe}{build_recipe}.
-   A target can be a file or a \gref{phony target}{phony_target} that simply triggers an action.
-   When a target is out of date with respect to its prerequisites, Make executes the recipe associated with its rule.
-   Make executes as many rules as it needs to when updating files, but always respects prerequisite order.
-   Make defines \gref{automatic variables}{automatic_variable} such as `$@` (target), `$^` (all prerequisites), and `$<` (first prerequisite).
-   \gref{Pattern rules}{pattern_rule} can use `%` as a placeholder for parts of filenames.
-   Makefiles can define variables using `NAME=value`.
-   Make also has functions such as `$(wildcard...)` and `$(patsubst...)`.
-   Use specially formatted comments to create self-documenting Makefiles.

# Configuring Programs {#config}

> Always be wary of any helpful item that weighs less than its operating manual.
>
> --- Terry Pratchett\index{Pratchett, Terry}

In previous chapters we used command-line options to control our scripts and programs.
If they are more complex,\index{shell script!configuring}\index{Python!configuring program}
we may want to use up to four layers of configuration:

1.  A system-wide configuration file for general settings.
2.  A user-specific configuration file for personal preferences.
3.  A job-specific file with settings for a particular run.
4.  Command-line options to change things that commonly change.

This is sometimes called \gref{overlay configuration}{overlay_configuration}\index{overlay configuration}\index{configuration!overlay}
because each level overrides the ones above it:
the user's configuration file overrides the system settings,
the job configuration overrides the user's defaults,
and the command-line options overrides that.
This is more complex than most research software needs initially [@Xu2015],
but being able to read a complete set of options from a file
is a big boost to reproducibility.

In this chapter,
we'll explore a number approaches for configuring our Zipf's Law project,
and ultimately decide to apply one of them.
That project should now contain:

```text

## Configuration File Formats {#config-formats}

Programmers have invented far too many formats for configuration files;
rather than creating one of your own,
you should adopt some widely used approach.
One is to write the configuration as a Python module
and load it as if it was a library.
This is clever,
but means that tools in other languages can't process it.

A second option is [Windows INI format][ini-format],\index{Windows INI format}
which is laid out like this:

```ini
[section1]
key1=value1
key2=value2

[section2]
key3=value3
key4=value4
```

INI files are simple to read and write,
but the format is slowly falling out of use in favor of \gref{YAML}{yaml}.\index{YAML!configuration files}
A simple YAML configuration file looks like this:

```yaml
# Standard settings for thesis.
logfile: "/tmp/log.txt"
quiet: false
overwrite: false
fonts:
- Verdana
- Serif
```

Here,
the keys `logfile`, `quiet`, and `overwrite`
have the values `/tmp/log.txt`, `false`, and `false` respectively,
while the value associated with the key `fonts`
is a list containing `Verdana` and `Serif`.
For more discussion of YAML, see AppendixÂ \@ref(yaml).

## Matplotlib Configuration {#config-matplotlib}

To see overlay configuration in action,
let's consider a common task in data science:
changing the size of the labels on a plot.
The labels on our *Jane Eyre* word frequency plot are fine for viewing on screen
(FigureÂ \@ref(fig:configuration-jane-eyre-default)),
but they will need to be bigger
if we want to include the figure in a slideshow or report.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/config/jane-eyre-default.png" alt="Word frequency distribution for Jane Eyre with default label sizes." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:configuration-jane-eyre-default)Word frequency distribution for Jane Eyre with default label sizes.</p>
</div>

We could use any of the overlay options described above
to change the size of the labels:

-  Edit the system-wide Matplotlib configuration file\index{Matplotlib!configuration}
   (which would affect everyone using this computer).
-  Create a user-specific Matplotlib style sheet.
-  Create a job-specific configuration file to set plotting options in `plotcounts.py`.
-  Add some new command-line options to `plotcounts.py` .

Let's consider these options one by one.

## The Global Configuration File {#config-global}

Our first configuration possibility
is to edit the system-wide Matplotlib runtime configuration file,\index{configuration!global}
which is called `matplotlibrc`.
When we import Matplotlib,
it uses this file to set the default characteristics of the plot.
We can find it on our system by running this command:

```python
import matplotlib as mpl
mpl.matplotlib_fname()
```

```text
/Users/amira/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/matplotlib/
mpl-data/matplotlibrc
```

In this case the file is located in the Python installation directory (`anaconda3`).
All the different Python packages installed with Anaconda
live in a `python3.7/site-packages` directory,
including Matplotlib.

`matplotlibrc` lists all the default settings as comments.
The default size of the X and Y axis labels is "medium",
as is the size of the tick labels:

```yaml
#axes.labelsize    : medium  ## fontsize of the x and y labels
#xtick.labelsize   : medium  ## fontsize of the tick labels
#ytick.labelsize   : medium  ## fontsize of the tick labels
```

We can uncomment those lines and change the sizes to "large" and "extra large":

```yaml
axes.labelsize     : x-large  ## fontsize of the x and y labels
xtick.labelsize    : large    ## fontsize of the tick labels
ytick.labelsize    : large    ## fontsize of the tick labels
```
and then re-generate the *Jane Eyre* plot with bigger labels
(FigureÂ \@ref(fig:configuration-jane-eyre-big-labels)):

```python
$ python bin/plotcounts.py results/jane_eyre.csv --outfile
  results/jane_eyre.png
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/config/jane-eyre-big-labels.png" alt="Word frequency distribution for Jane Eyre with larger labels." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:configuration-jane-eyre-big-labels)Word frequency distribution for Jane Eyre with larger labels.</p>
</div>

This does what we want,
but is usually the wrong approach.
Since the `matplotlibrc` file sets system-wide defaults,
we will now have big labels by default for all plotting we do in the future,
which we may not want.
Secondly,
we want to package our Zipf's Law code and make it available to other people (ChapterÂ \@ref(packaging)).
That package won't include our `matplotlibrc` file,
and we don't have access to the one on their computer,
so this solution isn't as reproducible as others.

A global options file *is* useful, though.
If we are using Matplotlib with \gref{LaTeX}{latex} to generate reports
and the latter is installed in an unusual place on our computing cluster,
a one-line change in `matplotlibrc` can prevent a lot of failed jobs.

## The User Configuration File {#config-user}

If we don't want to change the configuration for everyone,
we can change it for just ourself.
Matplotlib defines several carefully designed styles for plots:\index{configuration!user}

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
print(plt.style.available)
```

```text
['seaborn-dark', 'seaborn-darkgrid', 'seaborn-ticks',
'fivethirtyeight', 'seaborn-whitegrid', 'classic',
'_classic_test', 'fast', 'seaborn-talk', 'seaborn-dark-palette',
'seaborn-bright', 'seaborn-pastel', 'grayscale',
'seaborn-notebook', 'ggplot', 'seaborn-colorblind',
'seaborn-muted', 'seaborn', 'Solarize_Light2', 'seaborn-paper',
'bmh', 'tableau-colorblind10', 'seaborn-white',
'dark_background', 'seaborn-poster', 'seaborn-deep']
```

In order to make the labels bigger in all of our Zipf's Law plots,
we could create a custom Matplotlib style sheet.
The convention is to store custom style sheets in a `stylelib` sub-directory
in the Matplotlib configuration directory.
That directory can be located by running the following command:

```python
mpl.get_configdir()
```

```text
/Users/amira/.matplotlib
```

Once we've created the new sub-directory:

```bash
$ mkdir /Users/amira/.matplotlib/stylelib
```

we can add a new file called `big-labels.mplstyle`
that has the same YAML format as the `matplotlibrc` file:

```python
axes.labelsize   : x-large  ## fontsize of the x and y labels
xtick.labelsize  : large    ## fontsize of the tick labels
ytick.labelsize  : large    ## fontsize of the tick labels
```

To use this new style,
we would just need to add one line to `plotcounts.py`:

```python
plt.style.use('big-labels')
```

Using a custom style sheet leaves the system-wide defaults unchanged,
and it's a good way to achieve a consistent look across our personal data visualization projects.
However,
since each user has their own `stylelib` directory,
it doesn't solve the problem of ensuring that other people can reproduce our plots.

## Adding Command-Line Options {#config-command-line}

A third way to change the plot's properties\index{configuration!command-line option}
is to add some new command-line arguments to `plotcounts.py`.
The `choices` parameter of `add_argument` lets us tell `argparse`
that the user is only allowed to specify a value from a predefined list:

```python
mpl_sizes = ['xx-small', 'x-small', 'small', 'medium',
             'large', 'x-large', 'xx-large']
parser.add_argument('--labelsize', type=str, default='x-large',
                    choices=mpl_sizes,
                    help='fontsize of the x and y labels')
parser.add_argument('--xticksize', type=str, default='large',
                    choices=mpl_sizes,
                    help='fontsize of the x tick labels')
parser.add_argument('--yticksize', type=str, default='large',
                    choices=mpl_sizes,
                    help='fontsize of the y tick labels')
```

We can then add a few lines after the `ax` variable is defined in `plotcounts.py`
to update the label sizes according to the user input:

```python
ax.xaxis.label.set_fontsize(args.labelsize)
ax.yaxis.label.set_fontsize(args.labelsize)
ax.xaxis.set_tick_params(labelsize=args.xticksize)
ax.yaxis.set_tick_params(labelsize=args.yticksize)
```

Alternatively,
we can change the default runtime configuration settings before the plot is created.
These are stored in a variable called `matplotlib.rcParams`:

```python
mpl.rcParams['axes.labelsize'] = args.labelsize
mpl.rcParams['xtick.labelsize'] = args.xticksize
mpl.rcParams['ytick.labelsize'] = args.yticksize
```

Adding extra command-line arguments is a good solution
if we only want to change a small number of plot characteristics.
It also makes our work more reproducible:
if we use a Makefile to regenerate our plots (ChapterÂ \@ref(automate)),
the settings will all be saved in one place.
However,
`matplotlibrc` has hundreds of parameters we could change,
so the number of new arguments can quickly get out of hand
if we want to tweak other aspects of the plot.

## A Job Control File {#config-job-file}

The final option for configuring our plots---the one we will actually adopt in this case---is
to pass a YAML file full of Matplotlib parameters to `plotcounts.py`.\index{configuration!file}
First,
we save the parameters we want to change in a file inside our project directory.
We can call it anything,
but `plotparams.yml` seems like it will be easy to remember.
We'll store it in `bin` with the scripts that will use it:

```yaml
# Plot characteristics
axes.labelsize   : x-large  ## fontsize of the x and y labels
xtick.labelsize  : large    ## fontsize of the tick labels
ytick.labelsize  : large    ## fontsize of the tick labels
```

Because this file is located in our project directory
instead of the user-specific style sheet directory,
we need to add one new option to `plotcounts.py` to load it:

```python
parser.add_argument('--plotparams', type=str, default=None,
                    help='matplotlib parameters (YAML file)')
```

We can use Python's `yaml` library to read that file:

```python
with open('plotparams.yml', 'r') as reader:
    plot_params = yaml.load(reader, Loader=yaml.BaseLoader)
print(plot_params)
```

```text
{'axes.labelsize': 'x-large',
 'xtick.labelsize': 'large',
 'ytick.labelsize': 'large'}
```

and then loop over each item in `plot_params` to update Matplotlib's `mpl.rcParams`:

```python
for (param, value) in param_dict.items():
    mpl.rcParams[param] = value
```

`plotcounts.py` now looks like this:

```python
"""Plot word counts."""

import argparse

import yaml
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib as mpl
from scipy.optimize import minimize_scalar


def nlog_likelihood(beta, counts):
    # ...as before...


def get_power_law_params(word_counts):
    # ...as before...


def set_plot_params(param_file):
    """Set the matplotlib parameters."""
    if param_file:
        with open(param_file, 'r') as reader:
            param_dict = yaml.load(reader,
                                   Loader=yaml.BaseLoader)
    else:
        param_dict = {}
    for param, value in param_dict.items():
        mpl.rcParams[param] = value


def plot_fit(curve_xmin, curve_xmax, max_rank, beta, ax):
    # ...as before...


def main(args):
    """Run the command line program."""
    set_plot_params(args.plotparams)
    df = pd.read_csv(args.infile, header=None,
                     names=('word', 'word_frequency'))
    df['rank'] = df['word_frequency'].rank(ascending=False,
                                           method='max')
    ax = df.plot.scatter(x='word_frequency',
                         y='rank', loglog=True,
                         figsize=[12, 6],
                         grid=True,
                         xlim=args.xlim)

    word_counts = df['word_frequency'].to_numpy()
    alpha = get_power_law_params(word_counts)
    print('alpha:', alpha)

    # Since the ranks are already sorted, we can take the last
    # one instead of computing which row has the highest rank
    max_rank = df['rank'].to_numpy()[-1]

    # Use the range of the data as the boundaries
    # when drawing the power law curve
    curve_xmin = df['word_frequency'].min()
    curve_xmax = df['word_frequency'].max()

    plot_fit(curve_xmin, curve_xmax, max_rank, alpha, ax)
    ax.figure.savefig(args.outfile)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=__doc__)
    parser.add_argument('infile', type=argparse.FileType('r'),
                        nargs='?', default='-',
                        help='Word count csv file name')
    parser.add_argument('--outfile', type=str,
                        default='plotcounts.png',
                        help='Output image file name')
    parser.add_argument('--xlim', type=float, nargs=2,
                        metavar=('XMIN', 'XMAX'),
                        default=None, help='X-axis limits')
    parser.add_argument('--plotparams', type=str, default=None,
                        help='matplotlib parameters (YAML file)')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    main(args)
```

## Summary {#config-summary}

Programs are only useful if they can be controlled,
and work is only reproducible if those controls are explicit and shareable.
If the number of controls needed is small,
adding command-line options to programs and setting those options in Makefiles
is usually the best solution.
As the number of options grows,
so too does the value of putting options in files of their own.
And if we are installing the software on large systems that are used by many people,
such as a research cluster,
system-wide configuration files let us hide the details
from people who just want to get their science done.

More generally,
the problem of configuring a program illustrates the difference
between "works for me on my machine"
and "works for everyone, everywhere."
From reproducible workflows (ChapterÂ \@ref(automate)) to logging (SectionÂ \@ref(errors-logging)),
this difference influences every aspect of a research software engineer's work.
We don't always have to design for large-scale re-use,
but knowing what it entails allows us to make a conscious, thoughtful choice.

## Exercises {#config-exercises}

### Building with plotting parameters {#config-ex-build-plotparams}

In the `Makefile` created in ChapterÂ \@ref(automate),
the build rule involving `plotcounts.py` was defined as:

```makefile
## results/collated.png: plot the collated results.
results/collated.png : results/collated.csv
	python $(PLOT) $< --outfile $@
```

Update that build rule to include the new `--plotparams` option.
Make sure `plotparams.yml` is added as a second prerequisite in the updated build rule
so that the appropriate commands will be re-run if the plotting parameters change.

Hint: We use the automatic variable `$<` to access the first prerequisite,
but you'll need `$(word 2,$^)` to access the second.
Read about automatic variables (SectionÂ \@ref(automate-autovar)) and
[functions for string substitution and analysis][make-string-functions]
to understand what that command is doing.

### Using different plot styles {#config-ex-style}

There are many pre-defined matplotlib styles (SectionÂ \@ref(config-user)),
as illustrated at the [Python Graph Gallery][python-graph-gallery-styles].

1. Add a new option `--style` to `plotcounts.py` that allows the user
to pick a style from the list of pre-defined matplotlib styles.

Hint: Use the `choices` parameter discussed in SectionÂ \@ref(config-command-line)
to define the valid choices for the new `--style` option.

2. Re-generate the plot of the *Jane Eyre* word count distribution
using a bunch of different styles to decide which you like best.

3. Matplotlib style sheets are designed to be composed together.
(See the [style sheets tutorial][matplotlib-style-tutorial] for details.)
Use the `nargs` parameter to allow the user to pass any number of styles
when using the `--style` option.

### Saving configurations {#config-ex-saveload}

1. Add an option `--saveconfig filename` to `plotcounts.py`
that writes all of its configuration to a file.
Make sure this option saves *all* of the configuration,
including any defaults that the user hasn't changed.

2. Add a new target `test-saveconfig` to the `Makefile`
created in ChapterÂ \@ref(automate) to test that the new option
is working.

3. How would this new `--saveconfig` option make your work more reproducible?

### Using INI syntax {#config-ex-ini}

If we used [Windows INI format][ini-format] instead of YAML
for our plot parameters configuration file
(i.e., `plotparams.ini` instead of `plotparams.yml`)
that file would read as follows:

```ini
[AXES]
axes.labelsize=x-large

[TICKS]
xtick.labelsize=large
ytick.labelsize=large
```

The [`configparser`][configparser] library can be used to read and write INI files.
Install that library by running `pip install configparser` at the command line.

Using `configparser`, rewrite the `set_plot_params` function in `plotcounts.py` to
handle a configuration file in INI rather than YAML format.

1.  Which file format do you find easier to work with?
2.  What other factors should influence your choice of a configuration file syntax?

Note: the code modified in this exercise is not required for the rest of the book.

### Configuration consistency {#config-ex-consistency}

In order for a data processing pipeline to work correctly,
some of the configuration parameters for ProgramÂ A and ProgramÂ B must be the same.
However,
the programs were written by different teams,
and each has its own configuration file.
What steps could you take to ensure the required consistency?

## Key Points {#config-keypoints}


-   \gref{Overlay configuration}{overlay_configuration} specifies settings for a program in layers,
    each of which overrides previous layers.
-   Use a system-wide configuration file for general settings.
-   Use a user-specific configuration file for personal preferences.
-   Use a job-specific configuration file with settings for a particular run.
-   Use command-line options to change things that commonly change.
-   Use \gref{YAML}{yaml_glossary} or some other standard syntax to write configuration files.
-   Save configuration information to make your research \gref{reproducible}{reproducible_research}.

We have written software to count and analyze the words in classic texts,
but how can we be sure it's producing reliable results?
The short is answer is that we can't---not completely---but
we can test its behavior against our expectations to decide if we are sure enough.
This chapter explores ways to do this,
including assertions, unit tests, integration tests, and regression tests.

```

## Assertions {#testing-assertions}

The first step in building confidence in our programs
is to assume that mistakes will happen and guard against them.
This is called \gref{defensive programming}{defensive_programming},\index{defensive programming}
and the most common way to do it is to add \gref{assertions}{assertion} to our code\index{assertion}\index{Python!assertion}
so that it checks itself as it runs.
An assertion is a statement that something must be true at a certain point in a program.
When Python sees an assertion, it checks the assertion's condition.
If it's true, Python does nothing;
if it's false,
Python halts the program immediately and prints a user-defined error message.
For example,
this code halts as soon as the loop encounters an impossible word frequency:

```python
frequencies = [13, 10, 2, -4, 5, 6, 25]
total = 0.0
for freq in frequencies[:5]:
    assert freq >= 0.0, 'Word frequencies must be non-negative'
    total += freq
print('total frequency of first 5 words:', total)
```

```text
---------------------------------------------------------------
AssertionError                Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-19-33d87ea29ae4> in <module>()
      2 total = 0.0
      3 for freq in frequencies[:5]:
----> 4     assert freq >= 0.0, 'Word frequencies must be
            non-negative'
      5     total += freq
      6 print('total frequency of first 5 words:', total)

AssertionError: Word frequencies must be non-negative
```

Programs intended for widespread use are full of assertions:
10%--20% of the code they contain are there to check that the other 80%--90% are working correctly.
Broadly speaking, assertions fall into three categories:

-   A \gref{precondition}{precondition}\index{precondition (in program)}\index{assertion!precondition}
    is something that must be true at the start of a function
    in order for it to work correctly.
    For example,
    a function might check that the list it has been given has at least two elements
    and that all of its elements are integers.

-   A \gref{postcondition}{postcondition}\index{postcondition (in program)}\index{assertion!postcondition}
    is something that the function guarantees is true
    when it finishes.
    For example,
    a function could check that the value being returned is an integer
    that is greater than zero,
    but less than the length of the input list.

-   An \gref{invariant}{invariant}\index{invariant (in program)}\index{assertion!invariant}
    is something that is true for every iteration in a loop.
    The invariant might be a property of the data (as in the example above),
    or it might be something like,
    "the value of `highest` is less than or equal to the current loop index."

The function `get_power_law_params` in our `plotcounts.py` script
is a good example of the need for a precondition.
Its docstring does not say that its `word_counts` parameter must be a list of numeric word counts;
even if we add that,
a user might easily pass in a list of the words themselves instead.
Adding an assertion makes the requirement clearer,
and also guarantees that the function will fail as soon as it is called
rather than returning an error from `scipy.optimize.minimize_scalar`
that would be more difficult to interpret/debug.

```python
def get_power_law_params(word_counts):
    """
    Get the power law parameters.

    return alpha
```

Update `plotcounts.py` with the assertion described above.
You'll see additional examples of assertions throughout this chapter.

## Unit Testing {#testing-unit}

Catching errors is good, but preventing them is better,
so responsible programmers test their code.
As the name suggests,
a \gref{unit test}{unit_test}\index{unit test}\index{testing!unit test}
checks the correctness of a single unit of software.
Exactly what constitutes a "unit" is subjective,
but it typically means the behavior of a single function in one situation.
In our Zipf's Law software,
the `count_words` function in `countwords.py` is
a good candidate for unit testing:

```python
def count_words(reader):
    """Count the occurrence of each word in a string."""
    text = reader.read()
    chunks = text.split()
    npunc = [word.strip(string.punctuation) for word in chunks]
    word_list = [word.lower() for word in npunc if word]
    word_counts = Counter(word_list)
    return word_counts
```

\newpage

A single unit test will typically have:

-   a \gref{fixture}{fixture},\index{testing!fixture}\index{fixture (of test)}
    which is the thing being tested (e.g., an array of numbers);
-   an \gref{actual result}{actual_result},\index{testing!actual result}\index{actual result (of test)}
    which is what the code produces when given the fixture;
    and
-   an \gref{expected result}{expected_result}\index{testing!expected result}\index{expected result (of test)}
    that the actual result is compared to.

The fixture is typically a subset or smaller version of the data
the function will typically process.
For instance,
in order to write a unit test for the `count_words` function,
we could use a piece of text small enough for us to count word frequencies by hand.
Let's add the poem *Risk* by AnaÃ¯s Nin to our data:

```bash
$ cd ~/zipf
$ mkdir test_data
$ cat test_data/risk.txt
```

```text
And then the day came,
when the risk
to remain tight
in a bud
was more painful
than the risk
it took
to blossom.
```

We can then count the words by hand to construct the expected result:

```python
from collections import Counter


risk_poem_counts = {'the': 3, 'risk': 2, 'to': 2, 'and': 1,
  'then': 1, 'day': 1, 'came': 1, 'when': 1, 'remain': 1,
  'tight': 1, 'in': 1, 'a': 1, 'bud': 1, 'was': 1,
  'more': 1, 'painful': 1, 'than': 1, 'it': 1, 'took': 1,
  'blossom': 1}
expected_result = Counter(risk_poem_counts)
```

We then generate the actual result by calling `count_words`,
and use an assertion to check if it is what we expected:

```python
import sys
sys.path.append('/Users/amira/zipf/bin')
import countwords


with open('test_data/risk.txt', 'r') as reader:
    actual_result = countwords.count_words(reader)
assert actual_result == expected_result
```

There's no output,
which means the assertion (and test) passed.
(Remember, assertions only do something if the condition is false.)

## Testing Frameworks {#testing-framework}

Writing one unit test is easy enough,
but we should check other cases as well.
To manage them,
we can use a \gref{test framework}{test_framework}\index{test framework}\index{testing!framework}
(also called a \gref{test runner}{test_runner}).
The most widely used test framework for Python is called [`pytest`][pytest],
which structures tests as follows:

1.  Tests are put in files whose names begin with `test_`.
2.  Each test is a function whose name also begins with `test_`.
3.  These functions use `assert` to check results.

Following these rules,
we can create a `test_zipfs.py` script in your `bin` directory
that contains the test we just developed:

```python
from collections import Counter

import countwords


def test_word_count():
    """Test the counting of words.

    The example poem is Risk, by AnaÃ¯s Nin.
    """
    risk_poem_counts = {'the': 3, 'risk': 2, 'to': 2, 'and': 1,
      'then': 1, 'day': 1, 'came': 1, 'when': 1, 'remain': 1,
      'tight': 1, 'in': 1, 'a': 1, 'bud': 1, 'was': 1,
      'more': 1, 'painful': 1, 'than': 1, 'it': 1, 'took': 1,
      'blossom': 1}
    expected_result = Counter(risk_poem_counts)
    with open('test_data/risk.txt', 'r') as reader:
        actual_result = countwords.count_words(reader)
    assert actual_result == expected_result
```

The `pytest` library comes with a command-line tool that is also called `pytest`.
When we run it with no options,
it searches for all files in or below the working directory
whose names match the pattern `test_*.py`.
It then runs the tests in these files and summarizes their results.
(If we only want to run the tests in a particular file,
we can use the command `pytest path/to/test_file.py`.)

```bash
$ pytest
```
```text
==================== test session starts ======================

===================== 1 passed in 0.02s =======================
```

To add more tests,
we simply write more `test_` functions in `test_zipfs.py`.
For instance,
besides counting words,
the other critical part of our code is the calculation of the \(\alpha\) parameter.
Earlier we defined a power law relating \(\alpha\)
to the word frequency \(f\),
the word rank \(r\),
and a constant of proportionality \(c\) (SectionÂ \@ref(git-advanced-theory)):

\[
r = cf^{\frac{-1}{\alpha}}
\]

We also noted that Zipf's Law holds exactly when \(\alpha\) is equal to one.
Setting \(\alpha\) to one and re-arranging the power law gives us:

\[
c = f/r
\]

We can use this formula to generate synthetic word count data
(i.e., our test fixture)
with a constant of proportionality set to a hypothetical maximum word frequency of 600
(and thus \(r\) ranges from 1 to 600):

```python
import numpy as np


max_freq = 600
counts = np.floor(max_freq / np.arange(1, max_freq + 1))
print(counts)
```

```text
[600. 300. 200. 150. 120. 100.  85.  75.  66.  60.  54.  50.
  46.  42.  40.  37.  35.  33.  31.  30.  28.  27.  26.  25.
 ...
   1.   1.   1.   1.   1.   1.   1.   1.   1.   1.   1.   1.]
```

(We use `np.floor` to round down to the nearest whole number,
because we can't have fractional word counts.)
Passing this test fixture to `get_power_law_params` in `plotcounts.py`
should give us a value of 1.0.
To test this, we can add a second test to `test_zipfs.py`:

```python
from collections import Counter

import numpy as np

import plotcounts
import countwords


def test_alpha():
    """Test the calculation of the alpha parameter.

    The test word counts satisfy the relationship,
      r = cf**(-1/alpha), where
      r is the rank,
      f the word count, and
      c is a constant of proportionality.

    To generate test word counts for an expected alpha of
      1.0, a maximum word frequency of 600 is used
      (i.e. c = 600 and r ranges from 1 to 600)
    """
    max_freq = 600
    counts = np.floor(max_freq / np.arange(1, max_freq + 1))
    actual_alpha = plotcounts.get_power_law_params(counts)
    expected_alpha = 1.0
    assert actual_alpha == expected_alpha


def test_word_count():
    #...as before...
```

Let's re-run both of our tests:

```bash
$ pytest
```

```text

      expected_alpha = 1.0

```

The output tells us that one test failed but the other test passed.
This is a very useful feature of test runners like `pytest`:
they continue on and complete all the tests
rather than stopping at the first assertion failure as a regular Python script would.

## Testing Floating-Point Values {#testing-numeric}

The output above shows that while `test_alpha` failed,
the `actual_alpha` value of 0.9951524579316625 was very close to the expected value of 1.0.
After a bit of thought,
we decide that this isn't actually a failure:
the value produced by `get_power_law_params` is an estimate,
and being off by half a percent is good enough.\index{testing!floating-point calculations}

This example shows that testing scientific software
almost always requires us to make the same kind of judgment calls
that scientists have to make when doing any other sort of experimental work.
If we are measuring the mass of a proton,
we might expect ten decimal places of accuracy.
If we are measuring the weight of a baby penguin,
on the other hand,
we'll probably be satisfied if we're within five grams.
What matters most is that we are explicit about the bounds we used
so that other people can tell what we actually did.

> **Degrees of Difficulty**
>
> There's an old joke that physicists worry about decimal places,
> astronomers worry about powers of ten,
> and economists are happy if they've got the sign right.

So how should we write tests when we don't know precisely what the right answer is?
The best approach is to write tests that check
if the actual value is within some \gref{tolerance}{tolerance} of the expected value.\index{testing!tolerance}\index{tolerance (of test)}
The tolerance can be expressed as the \gref{absolute error}{absolute_error},\index{absolute error}\index{error!absolute}
which is the absolute value of the difference between two,
or the \gref{relative error}{relative_error},\index{relative error}\index{error!relative}
which the ratio of the absolute error to the value we're approximating [@Gold1991].
For example,
if we add 9+1 and get 11,
the absolute error is 1 (i.e., \(11-10\)),
and the relative error is 10%.
If we add \(99+1\) and get 101,
on the other hand,
the absolute error is still 1,
but the relative error is only 1%.

For `test_alpha`,
we might decide that an absolute error of 0.01 in the estimation of \(\alpha\) is acceptable.
If we are using `pytest`,
we can check that values lie within this tolerance using `pytest.approx`:

```python
from collections import Counter

import pytest
import numpy as np

import plotcounts
import countwords


def test_alpha():
    """Test the calculation of the alpha parameter.

    The test word counts satisfy the relationship,
      r = cf**(-1/alpha), where
      r is the rank,
      f the word count, and
      c is a constant of proportionality.

    To generate test word counts for an expected alpha of
      1.0, a maximum word frequency of 600 is used
      (i.e. c = 600 and r ranges from 1 to 600)
    """
    max_freq = 600
    counts = np.floor(max_freq / np.arange(1, max_freq + 1))
    actual_alpha = plotcounts.get_power_law_params(counts)
    expected_alpha = pytest.approx(1.0, abs=0.01)
    assert actual_alpha == expected_alpha


def test_word_count():
    #...as before...
```

When we re-run `pytest`,
both tests now pass:

```bash
$ pytest
```

## Integration Testing {#testing-integration}

Our Zipf's Law analysis has two steps:
counting the words in a text
and estimating the \(\alpha\) parameter from the word count.
Our unit tests give us some confidence that these components work in isolation,
but do they work correctly together?
Checking that is called \gref{integration testing}{integration_test}.\index{testing!integration test}\index{integration test}

Integration tests are structured the same way as unit tests:
a fixture is used to produce an actual result
that is compared against the expected result.
However,
creating the fixture and running the code
can be considerably more complicated.
For example,
in the case of our Zipf's Law software, an appropriate integration test fixture
might be a text file with a word frequency distribution that has a known \(\alpha\) value.
In order to create this text fixture,
we need a way to generate random words.

Fortunately, a Python library called 
[`RandomWordGenerator`](https://github.com/AbhishekSalian/Random-Word-Generator) 
exists to do just that.
We can install it using [`pip`][pip], the Python Package Installer:

```bash
$ pip install Random-Word-Generator
```

Borrowing from the word count distribution we created for `test_alpha`,
we can use the following code to create a text file full of random words
with a frequency distribution that corresponds to an \(\alpha\) of approximately 1.0:

```python
import numpy as np
from RandomWordGenerator import RandomWord


max_freq = 600
word_counts = np.floor(max_freq / np.arange(1, max_freq + 1))
rw = RandomWord()
random_words = rw.getList(num_of_words=max_freq)
writer = open('test_data/random_words.txt', 'w')
for index in range(max_freq):
    count = int(word_counts[index])
    word_sequence = f'{random_words[index]} ' * count
    writer.write(word_sequence + '\n')
writer.close()
```

We can confirm this code worked by checking the resulting file:

```bash
tail -n 5 test_data/random_words.txt
```

```text
lZnkzoBHRb 
djiroplqrJ 
HmAUGOncHg 
DGLpfTIitu 
KALSfPkrga
```

We can then add this integration test to `test_zipfs.py`:

```python
def test_integration():
    """Test the full word count to alpha parameter workflow."""
    with open('test_data/random_words.txt', 'r') as reader:
        word_counts_dict = countwords.count_words(reader)
    counts_array = np.array(list(word_counts_dict.values()))
    actual_alpha = plotcounts.get_power_law_params(counts_array)
    expected_alpha = pytest.approx(1.0, abs=0.01)
    assert actual_alpha == expected_alpha
```

Finally,
we re-run `pytest` to check that the integration test passes:

```bash
$ pytest
```

```text

======================= 3 passed in 0.48s =====================
```

## Regression Testing {#testing-regression}

So far we have tested two simplified texts:
a short poem and a collection of random words with a known frequency distribution.
The next step is to test with real data,
i.e., an actual book.
The problem is,
we don't know the expected result:
it's not practical to count the words in *Dracula* by hand,
and even if we tried,
the odds are good that we'd make a mistake.

For this kind of situation we can use
\gref{regression testing}{regression_testing}.\index{testing!regression test}\index{regression test}
Rather than assuming that the test's author knows what the expected result should be,
regression tests compare today's answer with a previous one.
This doesn't guarantee that the answer is right---if the original answer is wrong,
we could carry that mistake forward indefinitely---but
it does draw attention to any changes (or "regressions").

In SectionÂ \@ref(git-advanced-zipf-verify)
we calculated an \(\alpha\) of 1.0866646252515038 for *Dracula*.
Let's use that value to add a regression test to `test_zipfs.py`:

```python
def test_regression():
    """Regression test for Dracula."""
    with open('data/dracula.txt', 'r') as reader:
        word_counts_dict = countwords.count_words(reader)
    counts_array = np.array(list(word_counts_dict.values()))
    actual_alpha = plotcounts.get_power_law_params(counts_array)
    expected_alpha = pytest.approx(1.087, abs=0.001)
    assert actual_alpha == expected_alpha
```

```bash
$ pytest
```

```text

```

## Test Coverage {#testing-coverage}

How much of our code do the tests we have written check?
More importantly,
what parts of our code \emph{aren't} being tested (yet)?
To find out,
we can use a tool to check their \gref{code coverage}{code_coverage}.\index{code coverage (of testing)}\index{testing!code coverage}
Most Python programmers use the `coverage` library,
which we can once again install using `pip`:

```bash
$ pip install coverage
```

Once we have it,
we can use it to run `pytest` on our behalf:

```bash
$ coverage run -m pytest
```

```text
===================== test session starts =====================
platform darwin -- Python 3.7.6, pytest-6.2.0, py-1.10.0,
pluggy-0.13.1
rootdir: /Users/amira

====================== 4 passed in 0.72s ======================
```

The `coverage` command doesn't display any information of its own,
since mixing that in with our program's output would be confusing.
Instead,
it puts coverage data in a file called `.coverage` (with a leading `.`) in the current directory.
To display that data,
we run:

```bash
$ coverage report -m
```

```text
bin/countwords.py      20      7    65%   25-26, 30-38
bin/plotcounts.py      58     37    36%   48-55, 75-77, 82-83, 
                                          88-118, 122-140
bin/test_zipfs.py      31      0   100%
bin/utilities.py        8      5    38%   18-22
-------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                 117     49    58%
```

This summary shows us that
some lines of `countwords.py` or `plotcounts.py`
were not executed when we ran the tests:
in fact,
only 65% and 36% of the lines were run respectively.
This makes sense,
since much of the code in those scripts
is devoted to handling command-line arguments or file I/O
rather than the word counting and parameter estimation functionality
that our unit, integration, and regression tests focus on.

To make sure that's the case,
we can get a more complete report by running `coverage html` at the command line
and opening `htmlcov/index.html`.
Clicking on the name of our `countwords.py` script, for instance,
produces the colorized line-by-line display shown in FigureÂ \@ref(fig:python-coverage).

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/testing/python-coverage.png" alt="Example of Python code coverage report." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:python-coverage)Example of Python code coverage report.</p>
</div>

This output confirms that all lines relating to word counting were tested,
but not any of the lines related to argument handling or I/O.

Is this good enough?
The answer depends on what the software is being used for and by whom.
If it is for a safety-critical application such as a medical device,
we should aim for 100% code coverage,
i.e.,
every single line in the application should be tested.
In fact,
we should probably go further and aim for 100% \gref{path coverage}{path_coverage}
to ensure that every possible path through the code has been checked.
Similarly,
if the software has become popular and is being used by thousands of researchers all over the world,
we should probably check that it's not going to embarrass us.

But most of us don't write software that people's lives depend on,
or that is in a "top 100" list,
so requiring 100% code coverage is like asking for ten decimal places of accuracy
when checking the voltage of a household electrical outlet.
We always need to balance the effort required to create tests
against the likelihood that those tests will uncover useful information.
We also have to accept that no amount of testing
can prove a piece of software is completely correct.
A function with only two numeric arguments has 2^128^ possible inputs.
Even if we could write the tests,
how could we be sure we were checking the result of each one correctly?

\newpage

Luckily,
we can usually put test cases into groups.
For example,
when testing a function that summarizes a table full of data,
it's probably enough to check that it handles tables with:

-   no rows
-   only one row
-   many identical rows
-   rows having keys that are supposed to be unique, but aren't
-   rows that contain nothing but missing values

Some projects develop \gref{checklists}{checklist} like this one\index{testing!checklist}
to remind programmers what they ought to test.
These checklists can be a bit daunting for newcomers,
but they are a great way to pass on hard-earned experience.

## Continuous Integration {#testing-ci}

Now that we have a set of tests,
we could run `pytest` every now and again to check our code.
This is probably sufficient for short-lived projects,
but if several people are involved,
or if we are making changes over weeks or months,
we might forget to run the tests
or it might be difficult to identify which change is responsible for a test failure.

The solution is \gref{continuous integration}{continuous_integration} (CI),\index{continuous integration}\index{CI (continuous integration)}
which runs tests automatically whenever a change is made.\index{testing!continuous integration}
CI tells developers immediately if changes have caused problems,
which makes them much easier to fix.
CI can also be set up to run tests with several different configurations of the software
or on several different operating systems,
so that a programmer using Windows
can be warned that a change breaks things for Mac users and vice versa.

One popular CI tool is [TravisÂ CI][travis-ci],
which integrates well with
[GitHub][github].\index{continuous integration!use with version control}\index{version control!and continuous integration}
If TravisÂ CI has been set up,
then every time a change is committed to a GitHub repository,
TravisÂ CI creates a fresh environment,
makes a fresh clone of the repository (SectionÂ \@ref(git-advanced-fork)),
and runs whatever commands the project's managers have set up.

Before setting up our account with Travis CI, however,
we need to prepare our repository to be recognized by the tool.
We'll first add a file called `.travis.yml` to our repository,
which includes instructions for Travis CI.
(The leading `.` in the name hides the file from casual listings on Mac or Linux,
but not on Windows.)
This file must be in the root directory of the repository,
and is written in \gref{YAML}{yaml_glossary}
(SectionÂ \@ref(config-formats) and AppendixÂ \@ref(yaml)).
For our project,
we add the following lines:

```yaml
language: python

python:
- "3.6"

install:
- pip install -r requirements.txt

script:

The `language` key tells TravisÂ CI which programming language to use,
so that it knows which of its standard \gref{virtual machines}{virtual_machine} to use\index{continuous integration!use of virtual machines}
as a starting point for the project.
The `python` key specifies the version or versions of Python to use,
while the `install` key indicates the name of the file (`requirements.txt`)
listing the libraries that need to be installed.
The `script` key lists the commands to run---in this case, `pytest`---which
in turn executes our project scripts
(i.e., `test_zipfs.py`, `plotcounts.py`, `countwords.py` and `utilities.py`).
These scripts import a number of packages that don't come with the
[Python Standard Library][python-standard-library],
so these are what comprise `requirements.txt`:

```text
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
scipy
pytest
pyyaml
```

Be sure to save both `requirements.txt` and `.travis.yml`
to your project's root directory,
commit to your repository,
and push to GitHub,
or Travis CI will not be able to recognize your project.

We're now ready to set up CI for our project.
The basic steps are as follows:

1.  Create an account on [TravisÂ CI][travis-ci] (if we don't already have one).
2.  Link our TravisÂ CI account to our GitHub account (if we haven't done so already).
3.  Tell TravisÂ CI to watch the repository that contains our project.

Creating an account with an online service is probably a familiar process,
but linking our TravisÂ CI account to our GitHub account may be something new.
We only have to do this once
to allow TravisÂ CI to access all our GitHub repositories,
but we should always be careful when giving sites access to other sites,
and only trust well-established and widely used services.

We can tell Travis CI which repository we want it to watch
by clicking the "+" next to the "My Repositories" link
on the left-hand side of the TravisÂ CI homepage (FigureÂ \@ref(fig:testing-add-repo)).

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/testing/travis-add-repo.png" alt="Click to add a new GitHub repository to Travis CI." width="70%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:testing-add-repo)Click to add a new GitHub repository to Travis CI.</p>
</div>

To add the GitHub repository we have been using throughout this book,
find it in the repository list
(FigureÂ \@ref(fig:testing-list-repos)).
If the repository doesn't show up,
re-synchronize the list using the green "Sync account" button on the left sidebar.
If it still doesn't appear,
the repository may belong to someone else or be private,
or your required files may be incorrect.
Click the "Trigger a build" button to initiate your first test using Travis CI.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/testing/travis-list-repos.png" alt="Find Zipf's Law repository and trigger a build." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:testing-list-repos)Find Zipf's Law repository and trigger a build.</p>
</div>

Once your repository has been activated,
TravisÂ CI follows the instructions in `.travis.yml`
and reports whether the build passed (shown in green)
or produced warnings or errors (shown in red).
To create this report, TravisÂ CI has done the following:

1.  Created a new Linux virtual machine.
2.  Installed the desired version of Python.
3.  Run the commands below the `script` key.
4.  Reported the results at `https://travis-ci.com/USER/REPO`,
    where `USER/REPO`
    identifies the repository for a given user.

Our tests pass and the build completes successfully.
We can view additional details about the test by clicking on the
repository name
(FigureÂ \@ref(fig:testing-build-pass)).

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/testing/travis-build-pass.png" alt="Travis build overview (build succeeded)." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:testing-build-pass)Travis build overview (build succeeded).</p>
</div>

This example shows one of the other benefits of CI:
it forces us to be explicit about what we are doing and how we do it,
just as writing a Makefile forces us to be explicit about exactly how we produce results [@Zamp2020].

## When to Write Tests {#testing-tdd}

We have now met the three major types of test: unit, integration, and regression.
At what point in the code development process should we write these?
The answer depends on who you ask.

Many programmers are passionate advocates of a practice called
\gref{test-driven development}{tdd}
(TDD).\index{test-driven development}\index{testing!test-driven development}\index{TDD (test-driven development)}
Rather than writing code and then writing tests,
they write the tests first and then write just enough code to make those tests pass.
Once the code is working,
they clean it up (AppendixÂ \@ref(style-refactor)) and then move on to the next task.
TDD's advocates claim that this leads to better code because:

1.  Writing tests clarifies what the code is actually supposed to do.

2.  It eliminates \gref{confirmation bias}{confirmation_bias}.
    If someone has just written a function,
    they are predisposed to want it to be right,
    so they will bias their tests towards proving that it is correct
    instead of trying to uncover errors.

3.  Writing tests first ensures that they actually get written.

These arguments are plausible.
However,
studies such as @Fucc2016 and @Fucc2017 don't support them:
in practice,
writing tests first or last doesn't appear to affect productivity.
What *does* have an impact is working in small, interleaved increments,
i.e.,
writing just a few lines of code and testing it before moving on
rather than writing several pages of code and then spending hours on testing.

So how do most data scientists figure out if their software is doing the right thing?
The answer is spot checks:
each time they produce an intermediate or final result,
they scan a table, create a chart, or inspect some summary statistics
to see if everything looks OK.
Their heuristics are usually easy to state,
like "there shouldn't be NAs at this point" or "the age range should be reasonable,"
but applying those heuristics to a particular analysis always depends on
their evolving insight into the data in question.

By analogy with test-driven development,
we could call this process "checking-driven development."
Each time we add a step to our pipeline and look at its output,
we can also add a check of some kind to the pipeline to ensure that
what we are checking for remains true as the pipeline evolves or is run on other data.
Doing this helps reusability---it's amazing how often a one-off analysis
winds up being used many times---but the real goal is comprehensibility.
If someone can get our code and data,
then runs the code on the data,
and gets the same result that we did,
then our computation is reproducible,
but that doesn't mean they can understand it.
Comments help
(either in the code or as blocks of prose in a \gref{computational notebook}{computational_notebook}),
but they won't check that assumptions and invariants hold.
And unlike comments,
runnable assertions can't fall out of step with what the code is actually doing.

## Summary {#testing-summary}

Testing data analysis pipelines is often harder than testing mainstream software applications,
since data analysts often don't know what the right answer is [@Brai2018].
(If we did,
we would have submitted our report and moved on to the next problem already.)
The key distinction is the difference between \gref{validation}{validation},
which asks whether the specification is correct,
and \gref{verification}{verification},
which asks whether we have met that specification.
The difference between them is the difference between
building the right thing and building something right;
the practices introduced in this chapter will help with both.

## Exercises {#testing-exercises}

### Explaining assertions {#testing-ex-explain-assertions}

Given a list of numbers,
the function `total` returns the total:

```python
total([1, 2, 3, 4])
```

```text
10
```

The function only works on numbers:

```python
total(['a', 'b', 'c'])
```

```text
ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'a'
```

Explain in words what the assertions in this function check,
and for each one,
give an example of input that will make that assertion fail.

```python
def total(values):
    assert len(values) > 0
    for element in values:
        assert int(element)
    values = [int(element) for element in values]
    total = sum(values)
    assert total > 0
    return total
```

### Rectangle normalization {#testing-ex-rectangles}

A rectangle can be described using a tuple of four cartesian coordinates `(x0, y0, x1, y1)`,
where `(x0, y0)` represents the lower left corner and `(x1, y1)` the upper right.
In order to do some calculations,
suppose we need to be able to normalize rectangles so that the lower left corner
is at the origin (i.e., `(x0, y0) = (0, 0)`) and the longest side is 1.0 units long.
This function does that:

```python
def normalize_rectangle(rect):
    """Normalizes a rectangle so that it is at the origin
    and 1.0 units long on its longest axis.  Input should be
    (x0, y0, x1, y1), where (x0, y0) and (x1, y1) define the
    lower left and upper right corners of the rectangle."""

    # insert preconditions
    x0, y0, x1, y1 = rect
    # insert preconditions

    dx = x1 - x0
    dy = y1 - y0
    if dx > dy:
        scaled = float(dx) / dy
        upper_x, upper_y = 1.0, scaled
    else:
        scaled = float(dx) / dy
        upper_x, upper_y = scaled, 1.0

    # insert postconditions here

    return (0, 0, upper_x, upper_y)
```

In order to answer the following questions,
cut and paste the `normalize_rectangle` function into a new file called `geometry.py` 
(outside of your `zipf` project) and
save that file in a new directory called `exercises`.

1. To ensure that the inputs to `normalize_rectangle` are valid,
add \gref{preconditions}{precondition} to check that:
(a) `rect` contains 4 coordinates,
(b) the width of the rectangle is a positive, non-zero value (i.e., `x0 < x1`), and
(c) the height of the rectangle is a positive, non-zero value (i.e., `y0 < y1`).

2. If the normalization calculation has worked correctly,
the new `x1` coordinate will lie between 0 and 1 (i.e., `0 < upper_x <= 1.0`).
Add a \gref{postcondition}{postcondition} to check that this is true.
Do the same for the new `y1` coordinate, `upper_y`.

Running `normalize_rectangle` for a short, wide rectangle should pass your new
preconditions and postconditions:

```python
import geometry


geometry.normalize_rectangle([2, 5, 3, 10])
```

```text
(0, 0, 0.2, 1.0)
```

but will fail for a tall, skinny rectangle:

```python
geometry.normalize_rectangle([20, 15, 30, 20])
```

```text
AssertionError                  Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-3-f4e8cdf7f69d> in <module>
----> 1 geometry.normalize_rectangle([20, 15, 30, 20])

~/Desktop/exercises/geometry.py in normalize_rectangle(rect)
     19
     20     assert 0 < upper_x <= 1.0, \
     21         'Calculated upper X coordinate invalid'
---> 22     assert 0 < upper_y <= 1.0, \
     23         'Calculated upper Y coordinate invalid'
     24
     25     return (0, 0, upper_x, upper_y)

AssertionError: Calculated upper Y coordinate invalid
```

3. Find and correct the source of the error in `normalize_rectangle`.
Once fixed, you should be able to successfully run
`geometry.normalize_rectangle([20, 15, 30, 20])`.

4. Write a unit test for tall, skinny rectangles and save it in a new file called
`test_geometry.py`. Run `pytest` to make sure the test passes.

5. Add a couple more unit tests to `test_geometry.py`.
Explain the rationale behind each test.

### Testing with randomness {#testing-ex-random}

Programs that rely on random numbers are impossible to test
because there's (deliberately) no way to predict their output.
Luckily, computer programs don't actually use random numbers:
they use a \gref{pseudo-random number generator}{prng} (PRNG)
that produces values in a repeatable but unpredictable way.
Given the same initial \gref{seed}{seed},
a PRNG will always produce the same sequence of values.
How can we use this fact when testing programs that rely on pseudo-random numbers?

### Testing with relative error {#testing-ex-relative-error}

If E is the expected result of a function and A is the actual value it produces,
the \gref{relative error}{relative_error} is `abs((A-E)/E)`.
This means that if we expect the results of tests to be 2, 1, and 0,
and we actually get 2.1, 1.1, and 0.1
the relative errors are 5%, 10%, and infinity.
Why does this seem counter-intuitive,
and what might be a better way to measure error in this case?

## Key Points {#testing-keypoints}


-   Test software to convince people (including yourself) that software is correct enough
    and to make tolerances on "enough" explicit.
-   Add \gref{assertions}{assertion} to code so that it checks itself as it runs.
-   Write \gref{unit tests}{unit_test} to check individual pieces of code.
-   Write \gref{integration tests}{integration_test} to check that those pieces work together correctly.
-   Write \gref{regression tests}{regression_testing} to check if things that used to work no longer do.
-   A \gref{test framework}{test_framework} finds and runs tests written in a prescribed fashion and reports their results.
-   Test \gref{coverage}{code_coverage} is the fraction of lines of code that are executed by a set of tests.
-   \gref{Continuous integration}{continuous_integration} re-builds and/or re-tests software every time something changes.

# Handling Errors {#errors}

> "When Mister Safety Catch Is Not On, Mister Crossbow Is Not Your Friend."
>
> --- Terry Pratchett\index{Pratchett, Terry}

We are imperfect people living in an imperfect world.
People will misunderstand how to use our programs,
and even if we test thoroughly as described in the previous chapter,
those programs might still contain bugs.
We should therefore plan from the start to detect and handle errors.

Something that goes wrong while a program is running
is sometimes referred to as an \gref{exception}{exception} from normal behavior.\index{exception}
Generally speaking,
we distinguish between two types of errors/exceptions.
\gref{Internal errors}{internal_error},\index{error!internal}\index{internal error}
are mistakes in the program itself,
such as calling a function with `None` instead of a list.
\gref{External errors}{external_error}\index{external error} are usually caused
by interactions between the program and the outside world:
a user may mis-type a filename,
the network might be down,
and so on.

When an internal error occurs,
the only thing we can do in most cases is report it and halt the program.
If a function has been passed `None` instead of a valid list,
for example,
the odds are good that one of our data structures is corrupted.
We can try to guess what the problem is and take corrective action,
but our guess will often be wrong
and our attempt to correct the problem might actually make things worse.
When an external error occurs on the other hand,
we don't always want the program to stop.
If a user mis-types her password,
handling the error by prompting her to try again
would be friendlier than halting and requiring her to restart the program.

This chapter looks at how we can raise, catch and handle errors.
We consider how to write useful error messages,
and how to make our programs log those messages
along with other useful information as they are running,
so that it's easier to figure out what happened when something goes wrong.

## Exceptions {#errors-exceptions}

Most modern programming languages use exceptions for error handling.
As the name suggests,
an exception is a way to represent an exceptional or unusual occurrence
that doesn't fit neatly into the program's expected operation.
The code below uses exceptions to report attempts to divide by zero:

```python
for denom in [-5, 0, 5]:
    try:
        result = 1/denom
        print(f'1/{denom} == {result}')
    except:
        print(f'Cannot divide by {denom}')
```

```text
1/-5 == -0.2
Cannot divide by 0
1/5 == 0.2
```

`try`/`except` looks like `if`/`else` and works in a similar fashion.
If nothing unexpected happens inside the `try` block,
the `except` block isn't run (FigureÂ \@ref(fig:errors-control-flow)).
If something goes wrong inside the `try`,
on the other hand,
the program jumps immediately to the `except`.
This is why the `print` statement inside the `try` doesn't run when `denom` is 0:
as soon as Python tries to calculate `1/denom`,
it skips directly to the code under `except`.

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/errors/exceptions.png" alt="Exception control flow." width="40%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:errors-control-flow)Exception control flow.</p>
</div>

We often want to know exactly what went wrong,
so Python and other languages store information about the error
in an object (which is also called an exception).
We can \gref{catch}{catch_exception} an exception and inspect it as follows:\index{exception!catch}\index{catch exception}

```python
for denom in [-5, 0, 5]:
    try:
        result = 1/denom
        print(f'1/{denom} == {result}')
    except Exception as error:
        print(f'{denom} has no reciprocal: {error}')
```

```text
1/-5 == -0.2
0 has no reciprocal: division by zero
1/5 == 0.2
```

We can use any variable name we like instead of `error`;
Python will assign the exception object to that variable
so that we can do things with it in the `except` block.

Python also allows us to specify what kind of exception we want to catch.
For example,
we can write code to handle out-of-range indexing and division by zero separately:

```python
numbers = [-5, 0, 5]
for i in [0, 1, 2, 3]:
    try:
        denom = numbers[i]
        result = 1/denom
        print(f'1/{denom} == {result}')
    except IndexError as error:
        print(f'index {i} out of range')
    except ZeroDivisionError as error:
        print(f'{denom} has no reciprocal: {error}')
```

```text
1/-5 == -0.2
0 has no reciprocal: division by zero
1/5 == 0.2
index 3 out of range
```

Exceptions are organized in a hierarchy:\index{exception!hierarchy}
for example,
`FloatingPointError`, `OverflowError`, and `ZeroDivisionError`
are all special cases of `ArithmeticError`,
so an `except` that catches the latter will catch all three of the former,
but an `except` that catches an `OverflowError`
*won't* catch a `ZeroDivisionError`.
The Python documentation describes all of [the built-in exception types][python-exceptions];
in practice,
the ones that people handle most often are:

\newpage

-   `ArithmeticError`:
    something has gone wrong in a calculation.
-   `IndexError` and `KeyError`:
    something has gone wrong indexing a list or lookup something up in a dictionary.
-   `OSError`:
    thrown when a file is not found,
    the program doesn't have permission to read it,
    and so on.

So where do exceptions come from?
The answer is that programmers can \gref{raise}{raise_exception} them explicitly:\index{exception!raise}\index{raise exception}

```python
for number in [1, 0, -1]:
    try:
        if number < 0:
            raise ValueError(f'no negatives: {number}')
        print(number)
    except ValueError as error:
        print(f'exception: {error}')
```

```text
1
0
exception: no negatives: -1
```

We can define our own exception types,
and many libraries do,
but the built-in types are enough to cover common cases.

One final note is that exceptions don't have to be handled where they are raised.
In fact,
their greatest strength is that they allow long-range error handling.
If an exception occurs inside a function and there is no `except` for it there,
Python checks to see if whoever called the function is willing to handle the error.
It keeps working its way up through the \gref{call stack}{call_stack}\index{call stack}
until it finds a matching `except`.
If there isn't one,
Python takes care of the exception itself.
The example below relies on this:
the second call to `sum_reciprocals` tries to divide by zero,
but the exception is caught in the calling code
rather than in the function.

```python
def sum_reciprocals(values):
    result = 0
    for v in values:
        result += 1/v
    return result

numbers = [-1, 0, 1]
try:
    one_over = sum_reciprocals(numbers)
except ArithmeticError as error:
    print(f'Error trying to sum reciprocals: {error}')
```

```text
Error trying to sum reciprocals: division by zero
```

This behavior is designed to support a pattern called "throw low, catch high":
write most of your code without exception handlers,
since there's nothing useful you can do in the middle of a small utility function,
but put a few handlers in the uppermost functions of your program
to catch and report all errors.

We can now go ahead and add error handling to our Zipf's Law code.
Some is already built in:
for example,
if we try to read a file that does not exist,
the `open` function throws a `FileNotFoundError`:

```bash
$ python bin/collate.py results/none.csv results/dracula.csv
```

```text
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "bin/collate.py", line 35, in <module>
    main(args)
  File "bin/collate.py", line 23, in main
    with open(fname, 'r') as reader:
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory:
'results/none.csv'
```

But what happens if we try to read a file that exists,
but was not created by `countwords.py`?


```bash
$ python bin/collate.py Makefile
```

```text
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "bin/collate.py", line 35, in <module>
    main(args)
  File "bin/collate.py", line 24, in main
    update_counts(reader, word_counts)
  File "bin/collate.py", line 15, in update_counts
    for word, count in csv.reader(reader):
ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)
```

This error is hard to understand,
even if we are familiar with the code's internals.
Our program should therefore check that the input files are CSV files,
and if not,
raise an error with a useful explanation of what went wrong.
We could achieve this by wrapping the call to `open` in a `try/except` clause:

```python
for fname in args.infiles:
    try:
        with open(fname, 'r') as reader:
            update_counts(reader, word_counts)
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f'{fname} is not a CSV file.')
        print(f'ValueError: {e}')
```

```bash
$ python bin/collate.py Makefile
```

```text
Makefile is not a CSV file.
ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)
```

This is definitely more informative than before.
However,
*all* `ValueErrors` that are raised when trying to open a file
will result in this error message,
including those raised when we actually do use a CSV file as input.
A more precise approach in this case would be to throw an exception
only if some other kind of file is specified as an input:

```python
for fname in args.infiles:
    if fname[-4:] != '.csv':
        raise OSError(f'{fname} is not a CSV file.')
    with open(fname, 'r') as reader:
        update_counts(reader, word_counts)
```

```bash
$ python bin/collate.py Makefile
```

```text
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "bin/collate.py", line 37, in <module>
    main(args)
  File "bin/collate.py", line 24, in main
    raise OSError(f'{fname} is not a CSV file.')
OSError: Makefile is not a CSV file.
```

This approach is still not perfect:
we are checking that the file's suffix is `.csv`
instead of checking the content of the file
and confirming that it is what we require.
What we *should* do is check that there are two columns separated by a comma,
that the first column contains strings,
and that the second is numerical.

## Writing Useful Error Messages {#errors-messages}

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/scripting/error-message.png" alt="An unhelpful error message." width="60%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:errors-error-message)An unhelpful error message.</p>
</div>

The error message shown in FigureÂ \@ref(fig:errors-error-message) is not helpful.\index{error message!writing helpful}
Having `collate.py` print the message below would be equally unfriendly:

```text
OSError: Something went wrong, try again.
```

This message doesn't provide any information on what went wrong,
so it is difficult to know what to change for next time.
A slightly better message would be:

```text
OSError: Unsupported file type.
```

This tells us the problem is with the type of file we're trying to process,
but it still doesn't tell us what file types are supported,
which means we have to rely on guesswork or read the source code.
Telling the user "*filename* is not a CSV file"
(as we did in the previous section)
makes it clear that the program only works with CSV files,
but since we don't actually check the content of the file,
this message could confuse someone who has comma-separated values saved in a `.txt` file.
An even better message would therefore be:

```text
OSError: File must end in .csv
```

This message tells us exactly what the criteria are to avoid the error.

Error messages are often the first thing people read about a piece of software,
so they should therefore be the most carefully written documentation for that software.
A web search for "writing good error messages" turns up hundreds of hits,
but recommendations are often more like gripes than guidelines
and are usually not backed up by evidence.
What research there is gives us the following rules [@Beck2016]:

1.  Tell the user what they did, not what the program did.
    Putting it another way,
    the message shouldn't state the effect of the error,
    it should state the cause.

2.  Be spatially correct,
    i.e.,
    point at the actual location of the error.
    Few things are as frustrating as being pointed at line 28
    when the problem is really on line 35.

3.  Be as specific as possible without being or seeming wrong
    from a user's point of view.
    For example,
    "file not found" is very different from "don't have permissions to open file" or "file is empty."

4.  Write for your audience's level of understanding.
    For example,
    error messages should never use programming terms more advanced than
    those you would use to describe the code to the user.

5.  Do not blame the user, and do not use words like fatal, illegal, etc.
    The former can be frustrating---in many cases, "user error" actually isn't---and
    the latter can make people worry that the program has damaged their data,
    their computer,
    or their reputation.

6.  Do not try to make the computer sound like a human being.
    In particular, avoid humor:
    very few jokes are funny on the dozenth re-telling,
    and most users are going to see error messages at least that often.

7.  Use a consistent vocabulary.
    This rule can be hard to enforce when error messages are written by several different people,
    but putting them all in one module makes review easier.

That last suggestion deserves a little elaboration.\index{error message!lookup table}
Most people write error messages directly in their code:

```python
if fname[-4:] != '.csv':
    raise OSError(f'{fname}: File must end in .csv')
```

A better approach is to put all the error messages in a dictionary:

```python
ERRORS = {
    'not_csv_suffix' : '{fname}: File must end in .csv',
    'config_corrupted' : '{config_name} corrupted',
    # ...more error messages...
    }
```

and then only use messages from that dictionary:

```python
if fname[-4:] != '.csv':
    raise OSError(ERRORS['not_csv_suffix'].format(fname=fname))
```

Doing this makes it much easier to ensure that messages are consistent.
It also makes it much easier to give messages in the user's preferred language:

```python
ERRORS = {
  'en' : {
    'not_csv_suffix' : '{fname}: File must end in .csv',
    'config_corrupted' : '{config_name} corrupted',
    # ...more error messages in English...
  },
  'fr' : {
    'not_csv_suffix' : '{fname}: Doit se terminer par .csv',
    'config_corrupted' : f'{config_name} corrompu',
    # ...more error messages in French...
  }
  # ...other languages...
}
```

The error report is then looked up and formatted as:

```python
ERRORS[user_language]['not_csv_suffix'].format(fname=fname)
```

where `user_language` is a two-letter code for the user's preferred language.

## Testing Error Handling {#errors-testing}

An alarm isn't much use if it doesn't go off when it's supposed to.
Equally,
if a function doesn't raise an exception when it should
then errors can easily slip past us.
If we want to check that a function called `func`
raises an `ExpectedError` exception\index{testing!error handling}\index{exception!testing},
we can use the following template for a unit test:

```python
#...set up fixture...
try:
    actual = func(fixture)
    assert False, 'Expected function to raise exception'
except ExpectedError as error:
    pass
except Exception as error:
    assert False, 'Function raised the wrong exception'
```

\newpage

This template has three cases:

1.  If the call to `func` returns a value without throwing an exception
    then something has gone wrong,
    so we `assert False` (which always fails).

2.  If `func` raises the error it's supposed to,
    then we go into the first `except` branch
    *without* triggering the `assert` immediately below the function call.
    The code in this `except` branch could check that
    the exception contains the right error message,
    but in this case it does nothing
    (which in Python is written `pass`).

3.  Finally,
    if the function raises the wrong kind of exception
    we also `assert False`.
    Checking this case might seem overly cautious,
    but if the function raises the wrong kind of exception,
    users could easily fail to catch it.

This pattern is so common that `pytest` provides support for it.
Instead of the eight lines in our original example,
we can write:

```python
import pytest


#...set up fixture...
with pytest.raises(ExpectedError):
    actual = func(fixture)
```

The argument to `pytest.raises` is the type of exception we expect;
the call to the function then goes in the body of the `with` statement.
We will explore `pytest.raises` further in the exercises.

## Reporting Errors {#errors-logging}

Programs should report things that go wrong;\index{error message!reporting}
they should also sometimes report things that go right
so that people can monitor their progress.
Adding `print` statements is a common approach,
but removing them or commenting them out when the code goes into production is tedious and error-prone.

A better approach is to use a \gref{logging framework}{logging_framework},\index{logging framework}
such as Python's `logging` library.
This lets us leave debugging statements in our code
and turn them on or off at will.
It also lets us send output to any of several destinations,
which is helpful when our data analysis pipeline has several stages
and we are trying to figure out which one contains a bug.

To understand how logging frameworks work,
suppose we want to turn `print` statements in our `collate.py` program on or off
without editing the program's source code.
We would probably wind up with code like this:

```python
if LOG_LEVEL >= 0:
    print('Processing files...')
for fname in args.infiles:
    if LOG_LEVEL >= 1:
        print(f'Reading in {fname}...')
    if fname[-4:] != '.csv':
        msg = ERRORS['not_csv_suffix'].format(fname=fname)
        raise OSError(msg)
    with open(fname, 'r') as reader:
        if LOG_LEVEL >= 1:
            print(f'Computing word counts...')
        update_counts(reader, word_counts)
```

`LOG_LEVEL` acts as a threshold:
any debugging output at a lower level than its value isn't printed.
As a result,
the first log message will always be printed,
but the other two only in case the user has requested more details
by setting `LOG_LEVEL` higher than zero.

A logging framework combines the `if` and `print` statements in a single function call
and defines standard names for the \gref{logging levels}{logging_level}.\index{logging level}
In order of increasing severity,
the usual levels are:

-   `DEBUG`: very detailed information used for localizing errors.
-   `INFO`: confirmation that things are working as expected.
-   `WARNING`: something unexpected happened, but the program will keep going.
-   `ERROR`: something has gone badly wrong, but the program hasn't hurt anything.
-   `CRITICAL`: potential loss of data, security breach, etc.

Each of these has a corresponding function:
we can use `logging.debug`, `logging.info`, etc. to write messages at these levels.
By default,
only `WARNING` and above are displayed;
messages appear on \gref{standard error}{stderr}\index{standard error}
so that the flow of data in pipes isn't affected.
The logging framework also displays the source of the message,
which is called `root` by default.
Thus,
if we run the small program shown below,
only the warning message appears:

```python
import logging


logging.warning('This is a warning.')
logging.info('This is just for information.')
```

```text
WARNING:root:This is a warning.
```

Rewriting the `collate.py` example above using `logging`
yields code that is less cluttered:

```python
import logging


logging.info('Processing files...')
for fname in args.infiles:
    logging.debug(f'Reading in {fname}...')
    if fname[-4:] != '.csv':
        msg = ERRORS['not_csv_suffix'].format(fname=fname)
        raise OSError(msg)
    with open(fname, 'r') as reader:
        logging.debug('Computing word counts...')
        update_counts(reader, word_counts)
```

We can also configure logging to send messages to a file
instead of standard error\index{configuration!logging}\index{logging configuration}
using `logging.basicConfig`.
(This has to be done before we make any logging calls---it's not retroactive.)
We can also use that function to set the logging level:
everything at or above the specified level is displayed.

```python
import logging


logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, filename='logging.log')

logging.debug('This is for debugging.')
logging.info('This is just for information.')
logging.warning('This is a warning.')
logging.error('Something went wrong.')
logging.critical('Something went seriously wrong.')
```

```text
DEBUG:root:This is for debugging.
INFO:root:This is just for information.
WARNING:root:This is a warning.
ERROR:root:Something went wrong.
CRITICAL:root:Something went seriously wrong.
```

By default,
`basicConfig` re-opens the file we specify in \gref{append mode}{append_mode};\index{append mode}
we can use `filemode='w'` to overwrite the existing log data.
Overwriting is useful during debugging,
but we should think twice before doing it in production,
since the information we throw away often turns out to be
exactly what we need to find a bug.

Many programs allow users to specify logging levels and log filenames as command-line parameters.
At its simplest,
this is a single flag `-v` or `--verbose` that changes the logging level from `WARNING` (the default)
to `DEBUG` (the noisiest level).
There may also be a corresponding flag `-q` or `--quiet` that changes the level to `ERROR`,
and a flag `-l` or `--logfile` that specifies the name of a log file.
To log messages to a file while also printing them,
we can tell `logging` to use two handlers simultaneously:

```python
import logging


logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler("logging.log"),
        logging.StreamHandler()])

logging.debug('This is for debugging.')
```

The string `'This is for debugging'` is both printed to standard error
and appended to `logging.log`.

Libraries like `logging` can send messages to many destinations;
in production,
we might send them to a centralized logging server
that collates logs from many different systems.
We might also use \gref{rotating files}{rotating_file}\index{logging framework!rotating file}
so that the system always has messages from the last few hours
but doesn't fill up the disk.
We don't need any of these when we start,
but the data engineers and system administrators
who eventually have to install and maintain your programs
will be very grateful if we use `logging` instead of `print` statements,
because it allows them to set things up the way they want with very little work.

## Summary {#errors-summary}

Most programmers spend as much time debugging as they do writing new code,
but most courses and textbooks only show working code,
and never discuss how to prevent, diagnose, report, and handle errors.
Raising our own exceptions instead of using the system's,
writing useful error messages,
and logging problems systematically
can save us and our users a lot of needless work.

## Exercises {#errors-exercises}

This chapter suggested several edits to `collate.py`.
Suppose our script now reads as follows:

```python
"""
Combine multiple word count CSV-files
into a single cumulative count.
"""

import csv
import argparse
from collections import Counter
import logging

import utilities as util


ERRORS = {
    'not_csv_suffix' : '{fname}: File must end in .csv',
    }


def update_counts(reader, word_counts):
    """Update word counts with data from another reader/file."""
    for word, count in csv.reader(reader):
        word_counts[word] += int(count)


def main(args):
    """Run the command line program."""
    word_counts = Counter()
    logging.info('Processing files...')
    for fname in args.infiles:
        logging.debug(f'Reading in {fname}...')
        if fname[-4:] != '.csv':
            msg = ERRORS['not_csv_suffix'].format(fname=fname)
            raise OSError(msg)
        with open(fname, 'r') as reader:
            logging.debug('Computing word counts...')
            update_counts(reader, word_counts)
    util.collection_to_csv(word_counts, num=args.num)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=__doc__)
    parser.add_argument('infiles', type=str, nargs='*',
                        help='Input file names')
    parser.add_argument('-n', '--num',
                        type=int, default=None,
                        help='Output n most frequent words')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    main(args)
```

The following exercises will ask you to make further edits to `collate.py`.

### Set the logging level {#errors-ex-set-level}

Define a new command-line flag for `collate.py` called `--verbose` (or `-v`)
that changes the logging level from `WARNING` (the default)
to `DEBUG` (the noisiest level).

Hint: the following command changes the logging level to `DEBUG`:

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

Once finished,
running `collate.py` with and without the `-v` flag should produce the following output:

```bash
$ python bin/collate.py results/dracula.csv
  results/moby_dick.csv -n 5
```
```text
the,22559
and,12306
of,10446
to,9192
a,7629
```

```bash
$ python bin/collate.py results/dracula.csv
  results/moby_dick.csv -n 5 -v
```
```text
INFO:root:Processing files...
DEBUG:root:Reading in results/dracula.csv...
DEBUG:root:Computing word counts...
DEBUG:root:Reading in results/moby_dick.csv...
DEBUG:root:Computing word counts...
the,22559
and,12306
of,10446
to,9192
a,7629
```

### Send the logging output to file {#errors-ex-logging-output}

In ExerciseÂ \@ref(errors-ex-set-level),
logging information is printed to the screen when the verbose flag is activated.
This is problematic if we want to re-direct the output from `collate.py` to a CSV file,
because the logging information will appear in the CSV file
as well as the words and their counts.

1. Edit `collate.py` so that the logging information is sent to a log file
called `collate.log` instead.
(HINT: `logging.basicConfig` has an argument called `filename`.)

2. Create a new command-line option `-l` or `--logfile` so that the user
can specify a different name for the log file if they don't like
the default name of `collate.log`.

### Handling exceptions {#errors-ex-exceptions}

1.  Modify the script `collate.py` so that it catches any exceptions
    that are raised when it tries to open files
    and records them in the log file.
    When you are finished,
    the program should collate all the files it can,
    rather than halting as soon as it encounters a problem.
2.  Modify your first solution to handle nonexistent files
    and permission problems separately.

### Testing error handling {#errors-ex-error-handling}

In our suggested solution to the previous exercise, we modified `collate.py` to handle
different types of errors associated with reading input files.
If the `main` function in `collate.py` now reads:

```python
def main(args):
    """Run the command line program."""
    log_lev = logging.DEBUG if args.verbose else logging.WARNING
    logging.basicConfig(level=log_lev, filename=args.logfile)
    word_counts = Counter()
    logging.info('Processing files...')
    for fname in args.infiles:
        try:
            logging.debug(f'Reading in {fname}...')
            if fname[-4:] != '.csv':
                msg = ERRORS['not_csv_suffix'].format(
                    fname=fname)
                raise OSError(msg)
            with open(fname, 'r') as reader:
                logging.debug('Computing word counts...')
                update_counts(reader, word_counts)
        except FileNotFoundError:
            msg = f'{fname} not processed: File does not exist'
            logging.warning(msg)
        except PermissionError:
            msg = f'{fname} not processed: No read permission'
            logging.warning(msg)
        except Exception as error:
            msg = f'{fname} not processed: {error}'
            logging.warning(msg)
    util.collection_to_csv(word_counts, num=args.num)
```

1.  It is difficult to write a simple unit test for the lines of code dedicated
    to reading input files, because `main` is a long function that requires
    command-line arguments as input.  Edit `collate.py` so that the six lines of
    code responsible for processing an input file appear in their own function
    that reads as follows (i.e., once you are done, `main` should call
    `process_file` in place of the existing code):

```python
def process_file(fname, word_counts):
    """Read file and update word counts"""
    logging.debug(f'Reading in {fname}...')
    if fname[-4:] != '.csv':
        msg = ERRORS['not_csv_suffix'].format(
            fname=fname)
        raise OSError(msg)
    with open(fname, 'r') as reader:
        logging.debug('Computing word counts...')
        update_counts(reader, word_counts)
```

2.  Add a unit test to `test_zipfs.py` that uses `pytest.raises` to check that
    the new `collate.process_file` function raises an `OSError` if the input
    file does not end in `.csv`.  Run `pytest` to check that the new test
    passes.

3.  Add a unit test to `test_zipfs.py` that uses `pytest.raises` to check that
    the new `collate.process_file` function raises a `FileNotFoundError` if the
    input file does not exist.  Run `pytest` to check that the new test passes.

4.  Use the `coverage` library (SectionÂ \@ref(testing-coverage)) to check that
    the relevant commands in `process_file` (specifically `raise OSError` and
    `open(fname, 'r')`) were indeed tested.

### Error catalogs {#errors-ex-catalog}

In SectionÂ \@ref(errors-messages) we started to define an error catalog called `ERRORS`.

1. Read AppendixÂ \@ref(style-pep8) and explain why we have used capital letters
   for the name of the catalog.
2. Python has three ways to format strings:
   the `%` operator, the `str.format` method, and f-strings (where the "f" stands for "format").
   Look up the documentation for each
   and explain why we have to use `str.format` rather than f-strings
   for formatting error messages in our catalog/lookup table.
3. There's a good chance we will eventually want to use the error messages we've defined
   in other scripts besides `collate.py`.
   To avoid duplication,
   move `ERRORS` to the `utilities` module that was first created in
   SectionÂ \@ref(scripting-modules).

### Tracebacks {#errors-ex-traceback}

Run the following code:

```python
try:
    1/0
except Exception as e:
    help(e.__traceback__)
```

1.  What kind of object is `e.__traceback__`?
2.  What useful information can you get from it?

## Key Points {#errors-keypoints}


-   Signal errors by \gref{raising exceptions}{raise_exception}.
-   Use `try`/`except` blocks to \gref{catch}{catch_exception} and handle exceptions.
-   Python organizes its standard exceptions in a hierarchy so that programs can catch and handle them selectively.
-   "Throw low, catch high," i.e., raise exceptions immediately but handle them at a higher level.
-   Write error messages that help users figure out what to do to fix the problem.
-   Store error messages in a lookup table to ensure consistency.
-   Use a \gref{logging framework}{logging_framework} instead of `print` statements to report program activity.
-   Separate logging messages into `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `CRITICAL` levels.
-   Use `logging.basicConfig` to define basic logging parameters.

We have now developed, automated, and tested
a workflow for plotting the word count distribution for classic novels.
In the normal course of events,
we would include the outputs from that workflow (e.g., our figures and \(\alpha\) values)
in a research paper or a report for a consulting client.

But modern publishing involves much more than producing a PDF
and making it available on a preprint server such as [arXiv][arxiv] or [bioRxiv][biorxiv].
It also entails providing the data underpinning the report
and the code used to do the analysis:\index{reproducible research}

can't be published without violating personal or commercial confidentiality,
every researcher's default should be to make all these as widely available as possible.

## Data Provenance {#provenance-data}

The first step in documenting the data associated with a report
is to determine what (if anything) needs to be published.\index{publishing!data}
If the report involved the analysis of a publicly available dataset
that is maintained and documented by a third party,
it's not necessary to publish a duplicate of the dataset:
the report simply needs to document where to access the data
and what version was analyzed.
This is the case for our Zipf's Law analysis,
since the texts we analyze are available at [Project Gutenberg][project-gutenberg].

It's not strictly necessary to publish intermediate data
produced during the analysis of a publicly available dataset either
(e.g., the CSV files produced by `countwords.py`),
so long as readers have access to the original data and the code/software used to process it.
However,
making intermediate data available can save people time and effort,
particularly if it takes a lot of computing power to reproduce it
(or if installing the required software is complicated).
For example,
NASA has published
the [Goddard Institute for Space Studies Surface Temperature Analysis][gistemp],
which estimates the global average surface temperature
based on thousands of land and ocean weather observations,
because a simple metric of global warming is expensive to produce
and is useful in many research contexts.

If a report involves a new dataset,
such as observations collected during a field experiment,
then that data needs to be published in its raw (unprocessed) form.
The publication of a dataset,
whether raw or intermediate,
should follow the FAIR Principles.

### The FAIR Principles {#provenance-data-fair}

The [FAIR Principles][go-fair] describe what research data should look like.\index{FAIR Principles}\index{publishing!FAIR Principles}
They are still aspirational for most researchers,
but tell us what to aim for [@Good2014; @Mich2015; @Hart2016; @Broc2019; @Tier2020].
The most immediately important elements of the FAIR Principles are outlined below.

#### Data should be *findable*

The first step in using or re-using data is to find it.
We can tell we've done this if:

1.  (Meta)data is assigned a globally unique and persistent identifier
    (i.e., a \gref{DOI}{doi}).
2.  Data is described with rich metadata.
3.  Metadata clearly and explicitly includes the identifier of the data it describes.
4.  (Meta)data is registered or indexed in a searchable resource,
    such as the data sharing platforms described in SectionÂ \@ref(provenance-data-where).

#### Data should be *accessible*

People can't use data if they don't have access to it.
In practice,
this rule means the data should be openly accessible (the preferred solution)
or that authenticating in order to view or download it should be free.
We can tell we've done this if:

1.  (Meta)data is retrievable by its identifier
    using a standard communications protocol like HTTP.
2.  Metadata is accessible even when the data is no longer available.

#### Data should be *interoperable*

Data usually needs to be integrated with other data,
which means that tools need to be able to process it.
We can tell we've done this if:

1.  (Meta)data uses a formal, accessible, shared, and broadly applicable language for knowledge representation.
2.  (Meta)data uses vocabularies that follow FAIR principles.
3.  (Meta)data includes qualified references to other (meta)data.

#### Data should be *reusable*

This is the ultimate purpose of the FAIR Principles and much other work.
We can tell we've done this if:

1.  (Meta)data is described with accurate and relevant attributes.
2.  (Meta)data is released with a clear and accessible data usage license.
3.  (Meta)data has detailed \gref{provenance}{provenance}.
4.  (Meta)data meets domain-relevant community standards.

### Where to archive data {#provenance-data-where}

Small datasets (i.e., anything under 500 MB) can be stored in version control.\index{publishing!data!archiving}
If the data is being used in several projects,
it may make sense to create one repository to hold only the data;
these are sometimes referred to as \gref{data packages}{data_package},\index{data package}\index{publishing!data!package}
and they are often accompanied by small scripts to clean up and query the data.

For medium-sized datasets (between 500 MB and 5 GB),
it's better to put the data on platforms
like the [Open Science Framework][osf], [Dryad][dryad], 
[Zenodo][zenodo], and [Figshare][figshare],
which will give the dataset a DOI.
Big datasets (i.e., anything more than 5 GB)
may not be ours in the first place,
and probably need the attention of a professional archivist.

> **Data Journals**
>
> While archiving data at a site like Dryad or Figshare (following the FAIR Principles)
> is usually the end of the data publishing process,
> there is the option of publishing a journal paper to describe the dataset in detail.\index{publishing!data journal}
> Some research disciplines have journals devoted
> to describing particular types of data
> (e.g., the [Geoscience Data Journal][geoscience-data-journal])
> and there are also generic data journals
> (e.g., [Scientific Data][scientific-data]).

## Code Provenance {#provenance-code}

Our Zipf's Law analysis represents a typical data science project
in that we've written some code
that leverages other pre-existing software packages
in order to produce the key results of a report.\index{publishing!software}
To make a computational workflow like this open, transparent, and reproducible
we must archive three key items:

1.  A copy of any **analysis scripts or notebooks** used to produce the key results
    presented in the report.
2.  A detailed description of the **software environment**
    in which those analysis scripts or notebooks ran.
3.  A description of the **data processing steps** taken in producing each key result,
    i.e., a step-by-step account of which scripts were executed in what order
    for each key result.

\newpage

Unfortunately,
librarians, publishers, and regulatory bodies are still trying to determine
the best way to document and archive material like this,
so a widely accepted set of FAIR Principles for research software
is still under development [@Lamp2020].
In the meantime, the best advice we can give is presented below.
It involves adding information about the software environment
and data processing steps to a GitHub repository that contains
the analysis scripts/notebooks,
before creating a new release of that repository and archiving it (with a DOI)
with [Zenodo][zenodo].

### Software environment {#provenance-code-environment}

In order to document the software packages used in our analysis,
we should archive a list of the names and version numbers of each software package.
We can get version information for the Python packages we are using by running:

```bash
$ pip freeze
```

```text
alabaster==0.7.12
anaconda-client==1.7.2
anaconda-navigator==1.9.12
anaconda-project==0.8.3
appnope==0.1.0
appscript==1.0.1
asn1crypto==1.0.1
...
```

Other command-line tools will often have an option like `--version` or `--status`
to access the version information.

Archiving a list of package names and version numbers would mean that our
software environment is technically reproducible,
but it would be left up to the reader of the report
to figure out how to get all those packages installed and working together.
This might be fine for a small number of packages with very few dependencies,
but in more complex cases we probably want to make life easier for the reader
(and for our future selves looking to re-run the analysis).
One way to make things easier is to export a description of
a complete conda environment
(SectionÂ \@ref(packaging-virtualenv); AppendixÂ \@ref(anaconda-environments))\index{virtual environment},
which can be saved as YAML using:

```bash
$ conda env export > environment.yml
$ cat environment.yml
```
```text
name: base
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - _ipyw_jlab_nb_ext_conf=0.1.0=py37_0
  - alabaster=0.7.12=py37_0
  - anaconda=2019.10=py37_0
  - anaconda-client=1.7.2=py37_0
  - anaconda-navigator=1.9.12=py37_0
  - anaconda-project=0.8.3=py_0
  - appnope=0.1.0=py37_0
  - appscript=1.1.0=py37h1de35cc_0
  - asn1crypto=1.0.1=py37_0
...
```

That software environment can be re-created on another computer with one line of code:

```
$ conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Since this `environment.yml` file is an important part of reproducing the analysis,
remember to add it to your GitHub repository.

> However,
> their complexity can be daunting,
> and there is a lot of debate

### Data processing steps {#provenance-code-steps}

The second item that needs to be added to our GitHub repository is a description
of the data processing steps involved in each key result.\index{publishing!description of workflow}
Assuming the author list on our report is Amira Khan and Sami Virtanen (SectionÂ \@ref(intro-personas)),
we could add a new Markdown file called `KhanVirtanen2020.md` to the repository
to describe the steps:

```markdown
The code in this repository was used in generating the results
for the following paper:

Khan A & Virtanen S, 2020. Zipf's Law in classic english texts.
*Journal of Important Research*, 27, 134-139.

The code was executed in the software environment described by
`environment.yml`. It can be installed using
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/):
$ conda env create -f environment.yml

Figure 1 in the paper was created by running the following at
the command line:
$ make all
```

We should also add this information as an appendix to the report itself.

### Analysis scripts {#provenance-code-scripts}

Later in this book we will package and release our Zipf's Law code
so that it can be downloaded and installed by the wider research community,
just like any other Python package (ChapterÂ \@ref(packaging)).
Doing this is especially helpful if other people might be interested in using and/or extending it,
but often the scripts and notebooks we write to produce a particular figure or table
are too case-specific to be of broad interest.
To fully capture the provenance of the results presented in a report,
these analysis scripts and/or notebooks
(along with the details of the associated software environment and data processing steps)
can simply be archived with a repository like [Figshare][figshare] or [Zenodo][zenodo],
which specialize in storing the long tail of research projects
(i.e., supplementary figures, data, and code).
Uploading a zip file of analysis scripts to the repository is a valid option,
but more recently the process has been streamlined via direct integration
between GitHub and Zenodo.
As described in [this tutorial][github-zenodo-tutorial],
the process involves creating a new release of our repository in GitHub
that Zenodo copies and then issues a DOI for (FigureÂ \@ref(fig:provenance-release)).

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/provenance/release.png" alt="A new code release on GitHub." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:provenance-release)A new code release on GitHub.</p>
</div>

### Reproducibility versus inspectability {#provenance-inspectability}

In most cases,
documenting our software environment, analysis scripts, and data processing steps
will ensure that our computational analysis is reproducible/repeatable
at the time our report is published.\index{reproducible research}
But what about five or ten years later?
As we have discussed,
data analysis workflows usually depend on a hierarchy of packages.
Our Zipf's Law analysis depends on a collection of Python libraries,
which in turn depend on the Python language itself.
Some workflows also depend critically on a particular operating system.
Over time some of these dependencies will inevitably be updated or no longer supported,
meaning our workflow will be documented but not reproducible.

Fortunately,
most readers are not looking to exactly re-run a decade-old analysis:
they just want to be able to figure out what was run
and what the important decisions were,
which is sometimes referred to as \gref{inspectability}{inspectability}\index{inspectability}
[@Gil2016; @Brow2017].
While exact repeatability has a short shelf-life,
inspectability is the enduring legacy of a well-documented computational analysis.

## Summary {#provenance-summary}

The Internet started a revolution in scientific publishing
that shows no sign of ending.
Where an inter-library loan once took weeks to arrive
and data had to be transcribed from published papers
(if it could be found at all),
we can now download one another's work in minutes:
*if* we can find it and make sense of it.
Organizations like [Our Research][our-research] are building tools to help with both;
by using DOIs and ORCIDs,
publishing on preprint servers,
following the FAIR Principles,
and documenting our workflow,
we help ensure that everyone can pursue their ideas as we did.

## Exercises {#provenance-exercises}

### ORCID {#provenance-ex-get-orcid}

If you don't already have an \gref{ORCID}{orcid},
go to the website and register now.
If you do have an ORCID,
log in and make sure that your details and publication record are up-to-date.

### A FAIR test {#provenance-ex-fair-test}

An [online questionnaire][fair-questionnaire]
for measuring the extent to which datasets are FAIR
has been created by the Australian Research Data Commons.
Fill in the questionnaire for a dataset you have published or that you use often.

### Evaluate a project's data provenance {#provenance-ex-understand-project}

*This exercise is modified from @Wick2016 and explores the dataset from @Meil2016.
Go to the dataset's page <http://doi.org/10.3886/E17507V2> and download the files.
You will need to make an ICPSER account and agree to their data agreement before you can download.*

Review the dataset's main page to get a sense of the study,
then review the spreadsheet file and the coded response file.

1.  Who are the participants of this study?
2.  What types of data were collected and used for analysis?
3.  Can you find information on the demographics of the interviewees?
4.  This dataset is clearly in support of an article.
    What information can you find about it, and can you find a link to it?

### Evaluate a project's code provenance {#provenance-ex-eval-code}

The GitHub repository [`borstlab/reversephi_paper`][borstlab-reversephi] provides the code and data for the paper @Leon2017.
Browse the repository and answer the following questions:

1.  Where is the software environment described? What files would you need to re-create the software environment?
2.  Where are the data processing steps described? How could you re-create the results included in the manuscript?
3.  How are the scripts and data archived?
    That is, where can you download the version of the code and data as it was when the manuscript was published?

To get a feel for the different approaches to code provenance, repeat steps 1-3 with the following:

* [The figshare page][irving-figshare] that accompanies the paper @Irvi2019.

* The GitHub repo [`blab/h3n2-reassortment`][blab-h3n2-reassortment] that accompanies the paper @Pott2019.

### Making permanent links {#provenance-ex-permanent-links}

The link to the UK Home Office's [accessibility guideline posters][ukho-accessibility] might change in future.
Use the [Wayback Machine][wayback-machine] to find a link that is more likely to be usable in the long run.

### Create an archive of your Zipf's analysis {#provenance-ex-release}

A slightly less permanent alternative to having a DOI for your analysis code
is to provide a link to a GitHub release.
Follow [the instructions on GitHub][github-release] to create a release for the current state of your `zipf/` project.

Once you've created the release,
[read about how to link to it][github-release-link].
What is the URL that allows direct download of the zip archive
of your release?

> **What about getting a DOI?**
>
> Creating a GitHub release is also a necessary step
> to get a DOI through the Zenodo/GitHub integration
> (SectionÂ \@ref(provenance-code-scripts)).
> We are stopping short of getting the DOI here,
> since nobody reading this book needs to formally cite
> or archive the example Zipf's Law software we've been developing. 
> Also, if every reader of the book generated a DOI,
> we'd have many DOIs pointing to the same code!

### Publishing your code {#provenance-ex-publish-code}

Think about a project that you're currently working on.
How would you go about publishing the code associated with that project
(i.e., the software description, analysis scripts, and data processing steps)?

## Key Points {#publish-keypoints}


-   Publish data and code as well as papers.
-   Use \gref{DOIs}{doi} to identify reports, datasets, and software releases.
-   Use an \gref{ORCID}{orcid} to identify yourself as an author of a report, dataset, or software release.
-   Data should be [FAIR][go-fair]: findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.
-   Put small datasets in version control repositories; store large ones on data sharing sites.
-   Describe your software environment, analysis scripts, and data processing steps in \gref{reproducible}{reproducible_research} ways.
-   Make your analyses \gref{inspectable}{inspectability} as well as reproducible.

The more software we write,
the more we come to think of programming languages as a way to build and combine libraries.
Every widely used language now has an online repository
from which people can download and install those libraries.
This lesson shows you how to use Python's tools to create and share libraries of your own.

We will continue with our Zipf's Law project,
which should include the following files:

## Creating a Python Package {#packaging-package}

A package consists of one or more Python source files\index{Python package!structure}
in a specific directory structure
combined with installation instructions for the computer.
Python packages can come from various sources:
some are distributed with Python itself as part of the language's [standard library][python-standard-library],
but anyone can create one,
and there are thousands that can be downloaded and installed from online repositories.

> **Terminology**
>
> People sometimes refer to packages as modules.\index{Python package vs.\ module}
> Strictly speaking,
> a module is a single source file,
> while a package is a directory structure that contains one or more modules.

A generic package folder hierarchy looks like this:

```text
pkg_name
âââ pkg_name
âÂ Â  âââ module1.py
âÂ Â  âââ module2.py
âââ README.md
âââ setup.py
```

\newpage

The top-level directory is named after the package.
It contains a directory that is also named after the package,
and that contains the package's source files.
It is initially a little confusing to have two directories with the same name,
but most Python projects follow this convention because
it makes it easier to set up the project for installation.

> **`__init__.py`**
>
> Python packages often contain a file with a special name:
> `__init__.py`\index{\_\_init\_\_.py file (in Python package)}\index{Python package!\_\_init\_\_.py file}
> (two underscores before and after `init`).
> Just as importing a module file executes the code in the module,
> importing a package executes the code in `__init__.py`.
> Packages *had* to have this file before PythonÂ 3.3,
> even if it was empty,
> but since PythonÂ 3.3 it is only needed
> if we want to run some code as the package is being imported.

If we want to make our Zipf's Law software available as a Python package,
we need to follow the generic folder hierarchy.
A quick search of the [Python Package Index (PyPI)][pypi]
reveals that the package name `zipf` is already taken,
so we will need to use something different.
Let's use `pyzipf` and update our directory names accordingly:

```bash
$ mv ~/zipf ~/pyzipf
$ cd ~/pyzipf
$ mv bin pyzipf
```

> **Updating GitHub's Repository Name**
>
> We won't do it in this case
> (because it would break links/references from earlier in the book),
> but now that we've decided to name our package `pyzipf`,
> we would normally update the name of our GitHub repository to match.
> After changing the name at the GitHub website,
> we would need to update our `git remote` so that our 
> local repository could still be synchronized with GitHub: 
>
> ```bash
> $ git remote set-url origin 
>   https://github.com/amira-khan/pyzipf.git  
> ```

\newpage

Python has several ways to build an installable package.\index{Python package!building}
We will show how to use [`setuptools`][setuptools],\index{setuptools (in Python)}\index{Python!setuptools}
which is the lowest common denominator
and will allow everyone,
regardless of what Python distribution they have,
to use our package.
To use `setuptools`,
we must create a file called `setup.py` in the directory *above* the root directory of the package.
(This is why we require the two-level directory structure described earlier.)
`setup.py` must have exactly that name,
and must contain lines like these:

```python
from setuptools import setup


setup(
    name='pyzipf',
    version='0.1.0',
    author='Amira Khan',
    packages=['pyzipf'])
```

The `name` and `author` parameters are self-explanatory.
Most software projects use \gref{semantic versioning}{semantic_versioning}\index{semantic versioning}\index{Python package!semantic versioning}
for software releases.
A version number consists of three integers X.Y.Z,
where X is the major version,\index{software version number}
Y is the minor version,
and Z is the \gref{patch}{patch} version.\index{patch (of software version)}
Major version zero (0.Y.Z) is for initial development, so we have started with 0.1.0.
The first stable public release would be version 1.0.0,
and in general, the version number is incremented as follows:

-   Increment `major` every time there's an incompatible externally visible change.
-   Increment `minor` when adding new functionality in a backwards-compatible manner
    (i.e., without breaking any existing code).
-   Increment `patch` for backwards-compatible bug fixes that don't add any new features.

Finally,
we specify the name of the directory
containing the code to be packaged with the `packages` parameter.
This is straightforward in our case because we only have a single package directory.
For more complex projects,
the [`find_packages`][find-packages] function from `setuptools`
can automatically find all packages by recursively searching the current directory.

## Virtual Environments {#packaging-virtualenv}

We can add additional information to our package later,
but this is enough to be able to build it for testing purposes.
Before we do that,
though,
we should create a \gref{virtual environment}{virtual_environment}\index{virtual environment (in Python)}\index{Python!virtual environment}
to test how our package installs
without breaking anything in our main Python installation.
We exported details of our environment in ChapterÂ \@ref(provenance)
as a way to document the software we're using;
in this section,
we'll use environments to make the software we're creating more robust.

A virtual environment is a layer on top of an existing Python installation.
Whenever Python needs to find a package,
it looks in the virtual environment before checking the main Python installation.
This gives us a place to install packages that only some projects need
without affecting other projects.

Virtual environments also help with package development:

-   We want to be able to easily test install and uninstall our package,
    without affecting the entire Python environment.
-   We want to answer problems people have with our package with something more helpful than
    "I don't know, it works for me."
    By installing and running our package in a completely empty environment,
    we can ensure that we're not accidentally relying on other packages being installed.

We can manage virtual environments using [`conda`][conda] (AppendixÂ \@ref(anaconda)).
To create a new virtual environment called `pyzipf` we run `conda create`,\index{virtual environment (in Python)!creating}
specifying the environment's name with the `-n` or `--name` flag
and including `pip` and our current version of Python in the new environment:

```bash
$ conda create -n pyzipf pip python=3.7.6
```

```text
Collecting package metadata (current_repodata.json): done
Solving environment: done

## Package Plan ##

  environment location: /Users/amira/anaconda3/envs/pyzipf

  added / updated specs:
    - pip
    - python=3.7.6


The following packages will be downloaded:
...list of packages...

The following NEW packages will be INSTALLED:
...list of packages...

Proceed ([y]/n)? y

Executing transaction: done
#
# To activate this environment, use
#
#     $ conda activate pyzipf
#
# To deactivate an active environment, use
#
#     $ conda deactivate
```

`conda` creates the directory `/Users/amira/anaconda3/envs/pyzipf`,
which contains the subdirectories needed for a minimal Python installation,
such as `bin` and `lib`.
It also creates `/Users/amira/anaconda3/envs/pyzipf/bin/python`,
which checks for packages in these directories before checking the main installation.

> **`conda` Variations**
>
> As with many of the other tools we've explored in this book,

We can switch to the `pyzipf` environment by running:\index{virtual environment (in Python)!switching}

```bash
$ conda activate pyzipf
```

Once we have done this,
the `python` command runs the interpreter in `pyzipf/bin`:

```bash
(pyzipf)$ which python
```

```text
/Users/amira/anaconda3/envs/pyzipf/bin/python
```

Notice that every shell command displays `(pyzipf)` when that virtual environment is active.
Between Git branches and virtual environments,
it can be very easy to lose track of what exactly we are working on and with.
Prompts like this can make it a little less confusing;
using virtual environment names that match the names of your projects
(and branches, if you're testing different environments on different branches)
quickly becomes essential.

We can now install packages safely.
Everything we install will go into the `pyzipf` virtual environment
without affecting the underlying Python installation.
When we are done,
we can switch back to the default environment using `conda deactivate`:

```bash
(pyzipf)$ conda deactivate
```

```bash
$ which python
```

```text
/usr/bin/python
```

## Installing a Development Package {#packaging-installing}

Let's install our package in this virtual environment.\index{Python package!installation}
First we re-activate it:

```bash
$ conda activate pyzipf
```

Next,
we go into the upper `pyzipf` directory that contains our `setup.py` file
and install our package:

```bash
(pyzipf)$ cd ~/pyzipf
(pyzipf)$ pip install -e .
```

```text
Obtaining file:///Users/amira/pyzipf
Installing collected packages: pyzipf
  Running setup.py develop for pyzipf
Successfully installed pyzipf
```

The `-e` option indicates that we want to install the package in "editable" mode,
which means that any changes we make in the package code are directly available to use
without having to reinstall the package;
the `.` means "install from the current directory."

If we look in the location containing package installations 
(e.g., `/Users/amira/anaconda3/envs/pyzipf/lib/python3.7/site-packages/`),
we can see the `pyzipf` package beside all the other locally installed packages.
If we try to use the package at this stage,
though,
Python will complain that some of the packages it depends on,
such as `pandas`,
are not installed.
We could install these manually,
but it is more reliable to automate this process
by listing everything that our package depends on
using the `install_requires` parameter in `setup.py`:

```python
from setuptools import setup


setup(
    name='pyzipf',
    version='0.1',
    author='Amira Khan',
    packages=['pyzipf'],
    install_requires=[
        'matplotlib',
        'pandas',
        'scipy',
        'pyyaml',
        'pytest'])
```

We don't have to list `numpy` explicitly
because it will be installed as a dependency for `pandas` and `scipy`.\index{dependency!package}

> **Versioning Dependencies**
>
> It is good practice to specify the versions of our dependencies
> and even better to specify version ranges.
> For example, if we have only tested our package on pandas version 1.1.2,
> we could put `pandas==1.1.2` or `pandas>=1.1.2` instead of just `pandas`
> in the list argument passed to the `install_requires` parameter.

Next,
we can install our package using the modified `setup.py` file:

```bash
(pyzipf)$ cd ~/pyzipf
(pyzipf)$ pip install -e .
```

(The precise output of this command will change
depending on which versions of our dependencies get installed.)

We can now import our package in a script or a [Jupyter notebook][jupyter]
just as we would any other package.
For example,
to use the function in `utilities`,
we would write:

```python
from pyzipf import utilities as util


util.collection_to_csv(...)
```

To allow our functions to continue accessing `utilities.py`,
we need to change that line in both `countwords.py` and `collate.py`.

However,
the useful command-line scripts that we used to count and plot word counts
are no longer accessible directly from the Unix shell.
Fortunately there is an alternative to changing the function import
as described above.
The `setuptools` package allows us to install programs along with the package.\index{Python package!installing programs}
These programs are placed beside those of other packages.
We tell `setuptools` to do this by defining
\gref{entry points}{entry_point} in `setup.py`:\index{entry point (in Python package)}\index{Python package!entry point}

```python
from setuptools import setup


setup(
    name='pyzipf',
    version='0.1',
    author='Amira Khan',
    packages=['pyzipf'],
    install_requires=[
        'matplotlib',
        'pandas',
        'scipy',
        'pyyaml',
        'pytest'],
    entry_points={
        'console_scripts': [
            'countwords = pyzipf.countwords:main',
            'collate = pyzipf.collate:main',
            'plotcounts = pyzipf.plotcounts:main']})
```

The right side of the `=` operator is the location of a function,
written as `package.module:function`;
the left side is the name we want to use to call this function from the command line.
In this case we want to call each module's `main` function;
right now, it requires an input argument `args`
containing the command-line arguments given by the user (SectionÂ \@ref(scripting-options)).
For example,
the relevant section of our `countwords.py` program is:

```python
def main(args):
    """Run the command line program."""
    word_counts = count_words(args.infile)
    util.collection_to_csv(word_counts, num=args.num)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=__doc__)
    parser.add_argument('infile', type=argparse.FileType('r'),
                        nargs='?', default='-',
                        help='Input file name')
    parser.add_argument('-n', '--num',
                        type=int, default=None,
                        help='Output n most frequent words')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    main(args)
```

We can't pass any arguments to `main` when we define entry points in our `setup.py` file,
so we need to change our script slightly:

```python
def parse_command_line():
    """Parse the command line for input arguments."""
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=__doc__)
    parser.add_argument('infile', type=argparse.FileType('r'),
                        nargs='?', default='-',
                        help='Input file name')
    parser.add_argument('-n', '--num',
                        type=int, default=None,
                        help='Output n most frequent words')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    return args


def main():
    """Run the command line program."""
    args = parse_command_line()
    word_counts = count_words(args.infile)
    util.collection_to_csv(word_counts, num=args.num)


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

The new `parse_command_line` function handles the command-line arguments,
so that `main()` no longer requires any input arguments.

Once we have made the corresponding change in `collate.py` and `plotcounts.py`,
we can re-install our package:

```bash
(pyzipf)$ pip install -e .
```

The output looks slightly different than the first run
because `pip` could re-use some packages saved locally by the previous install
rather than re-fetching them from online repositories.
(If we hadn't used the `-e` option to make the package immediately editable,
we would have to uninstall it before reinstalling it during development.)

We can now use our commands directly from the Unix shell
without writing the full path to the file
and without prefixing it with `python`.

## What Installation Does {#packaging-installation}

Now that we have created and installed a Python package,
let's explore what actually happens during installation.\index{Python package!installation}
The short version is that
the contents of the package are copied into a directory that Python will search
when it imports things.
In theory we can "install" packages by manually copying source code into the right places,
but it's much more efficient and safer to use a tool specifically made for this purpose,
such as `conda` or `pip`.

Most of the time,
these tools copy packages into the Python installation's `site-packages` directory,\index{Python!site-packages directory}
but this is not the only place Python searches.
Just as the `PATH` environment in the shell contains a list of directories
that the shell searches for programs it can execute (SectionÂ \@ref(bash-advanced-vars)),
the Python variable `sys.path` contains a list of the directories it searches (Section \@ref(testing-unit)).
We can look at this list inside the interpreter:

```python
import sys
sys.path
```

```text
['',
'/Users/amira/anaconda3/envs/pyzipf/lib/python37.zip',
'/Users/amira/anaconda3/envs/pyzipf/lib/python3.7',
'/Users/amira/anaconda3/envs/pyzipf/lib/python3.7/lib-dynload',
'/Users/amira/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages',
'/Users/amira/anaconda3/envs/pyzipf/lib/python3.7/
site-packages',
'/Users/amira/pyzipf']
```

The empty string at the start of the list means "the current directory."
The rest are system paths for our Python installation,
and will vary from computer to computer.

## Distributing Packages {#packaging-distribute}

> **Look but Don't Execute**
>
> In this section we upload the `pyzipf` package
> to TestPyPI and PyPI:
>
> <https://test.pypi.org/project/pyzipf>

An installable package is most useful
if we distribute it so that anyone who wants it
can run `pip install pyzipf`\index{Python package!distribution}
and get it.
To make this possible,
we need to use `setuptools` to create
a \gref{source distribution}{source_distribution}\index{source distribution (of Python package)}\index{Python package!source distribution}
(known as an `sdist` in Python packaging jargon):

```bash
(pyzipf)$ python setup.py sdist

This creates a file named `pyzipf-0.1.tar.gz`,
located in a new directory in our project, `dist/`
(another directory to add to [`.gitignore`][github-gitignore]).
These distribution files can now be distributed via [PyPI][pypi],
the standard repository for Python packages.
Before doing that,
though,
we can put `pyzipf` on [TestPyPI][testpypi],
which lets us test the distribution of our package\index{Python package!testing distribution}
without having things appear in the main PyPI repository.
We must have an account,
but they are free to create.

The preferred tool for uploading packages to PyPI is called [twine][twine],
which we can install with:

```bash
(pyzipf)$ pip install twine
```

Following the [Python Packaging User Guide][pypi-user-guide],
we upload our distribution from the `dist/` folder
using the `--repository` option to specify the TestPyPI repository:

```bash
$ twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

so that it appears on the project webpage.

We can test that everything works as expected
by creating a virtual environment
and installing our package from TestPyPI 
(the `--extra-index-url` reference to PyPI below accounts for the fact that
not all of our package dependencies are available on TestPyPI):

```bash

Once again,
`pip` takes advantage of the fact that some packages already existing on our system
(e.g., they are cached from our previous installs)
and doesn't download them again.
Once we are happy with our package at TestPyPI,
we can go through the same process to put it on the main [PyPI][pypi] repository.

> **Python Wheels**
>
> When we installed our package from TestPyPI,

## Documenting Packages {#packaging-document}

Now that our package has been distributed,
we need to think about whether we have provided sufficient documentation.
Docstrings (Section \@ref(scripting-docstrings)) and READMEs
are sufficient to describe most simple packages,
but as our code base grows larger,
we will want to complement these manually written sections with automatically generated content,
references between functions,
and search functionality.
For most large Python packages,
such documentation is generated using a \gref{documentation generator}{documentation_generator}
called [Sphinx][sphinx],\index{Python package!documentation!Sphinx}
which is often used in combination with a free online hosting service called
[Read the Docs][readthedocs]\index{Read the Docs (for Python documentation)}.
In this section we will update our README file with some basic package-level documentation,
before using Sphinx and Read the Docs to host that information online
along with more detailed function-level documentation.
For further advice on writing documentation for larger and more complex packages,
see Appendix \@ref(documentation).

### Including package-level documentation in the `README` {#packaging-readme}

When a user first encounters a package,\index{Python package!documentation}
they usually want to know what the package is meant to do,
instructions on how to install it,
and examples of how to use it.
We can include these elements in the `README.md` file we started in ChapterÂ \@ref(git-advanced).
At the moment it reads as follows:

```bash
$ cat README.md
```

```text
# Zipf's Law

These Zipf's Law scripts tally the occurrences of words in text
files and plot each word's rank versus its frequency.

...
```

This file is currently written in [Markdown][markdown]\index{Markdown},
but Sphinx uses a format called \gref{reStructuredText}{restructured_text} (reST),\index{reST (reStructured Text)}\index{reStructured Text (reST)}
so we will switch to that.
Like Markdown,
reST is a plain-text markup format
that can be rendered into HTML or PDF documents
with complex indices and cross-links.
GitHub recognizes files ending in `.rst` as reST files and displays them nicely,
so our first task is to rename our existing file:

```bash
$ git mv README.md README.rst
```

We then make a few edits to the file formatting:
titles are underlined and overlined,
section headings are underlined,
and code blocks are set off with two colons (`::`) and indented.
We can also add some context about why to use the package,
as well as updated information about package installation:

```markdown
The ``pyzipf`` package tallies the occurrences of words in text
files and plots each word's rank versus its frequency together 
with a line for the theoretical distribution for Zipf's Law.

Motivation
----------

Zipf's Law is often stated as an observational pattern in the
relationship between the frequency and rank of words in a text:

`"â¦the most frequent word will occur approximately twice as
often as the second most frequent word,
three times as often as the third most
frequent word, etc."`
â `wikipedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law>`_

Many books are available to download in plain text format
from sites such as
`Project Gutenberg <https://www.gutenberg.org/>`_,
so we created this package to qualitatively explore how well
different books align with the word frequencies predicted by
Zipf's Law.

Installation
------------

``pip install pyzipf``

Usage
-----

After installing this package, the following three commands will
be available from the command line

- ``countwords`` for counting the occurrences of words in a text
- ``collate`` for collating multiple word count files together
- ``plotcounts`` for visualizing the word counts

A typical usage scenario would include running the following
from your terminal::

    countwords dracula.txt > dracula.csv
    countwords moby_dick.txt > moby_dick.csv
    collate dracula.csv moby_dick.csv > collated.csv
    plotcounts collated.csv --outfile zipf-drac-moby.jpg

Additional information on each function
can be found in their docstrings and appending the ``-h`` flag,
e.g., ``countwords -h``.

### Creating a web page for documentation {#packaging-sphinx}

Now that we've added package-level documentation to our README file,
we need to think about function-level documentation.
We want to provide users with a list of all the functions available in our package
along with a short description of what they do and how to use them.
We could achieve this by manually cutting and pasting function names and docstrings
from our Python modules (i.e., `countwords.py`, `plotcounts.py`, etc.),
but that would be a time-consuming process prone to errors as more functions are added over time.
Instead, we can use a \gref{documentation generator}{documentation_generator}
called [Sphinx][sphinx]\index{Python package!documentation!Sphinx}
that is capable of scanning Python code for function names and docstrings
and can export that information to HTML format for hosting on the web.

To start, let's install Sphinx and create a `docs/` directory at the top of our repository:

```bash
$ pip install sphinx
$ mkdir docs
$ cd docs
```

We can then run Sphinx's `quickstart` tool to create a minimal set of documentation
that includes the package-level information in the `README.rst` file we just created
and the function-level information in the docstrings we've written along the way.
It asks us to specify the project's name,
the name of the project's author,
and a release;
we can use the default settings for everything else.

```bash
$ sphinx-quickstart
```

```text
Welcome to the Sphinx 3.1.1 quickstart utility.

Please enter values for the following settings (just press Enter
to accept a default value, if one is given in brackets).

Selected root path: .

You have two options for placing the build directory for Sphinx
output. Either, you use a directory "_build" within the root
path, or you separate "source" and "build" directories within
the root path.
```

```bash
> Separate source and build directories (y/n) [n]: n
```

```text
The project name will occur in several places in the built
documentation.
```

```bash
> Project name: pyzipf
> Author name(s): Amira Khan
> Project release []: 0.1
```

```text
If the documents are to be written in a language other than
English, you can select a language here by its language code.
Sphinx will then translate text that it generates into that
language.

For a list of supported codes, see
https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/configuration.html
```

```bash
> Project language [en]:
```

```text
Creating file /Users/amira/pyzipf/docs/conf.py.
Creating file /Users/amira/pyzipf/docs/index.rst.
Creating file /Users/amira/pyzipf/docs/Makefile.
Creating file /Users/amira/pyzipf/docs/make.bat.

Finished: An initial directory structure has been created.

You should now populate your master file
/Users/amira/pyzipf/docs/index.rst and create other documentation
source files. Use the Makefile to build the docs, like so:
   make builder
where "builder" is one of the supported builders, e.g. HTML,
LaTeX or linkcheck.
```

`quickstart` creates a file called `conf.py` in the `docs` directory that configures Sphinx.
We will make two changes to that file
so that another tool called `autodoc` can find our modules (and their docstrings).
The first change relates to the "path setup" section near the head of the file:

```text
# -- Path setup -----------------------------------------------

# If extensions (or modules to document with autodoc) are in
# another directory, add these directories to sys.path here. If
# the directory is relative to the documentation root, use
# os.path.abspath to make it absolute, like shown here.
```

Relative to the `docs/` directory,
our modules (i.e., `countwords.py`, `utilities.py`, etc.) are located in the `../pyzipf` directory.
We therefore need to uncomment the relevant lines of the path setup section in `conf.py`
to tell Sphinx where those modules are:

```python
import os
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, os.path.abspath('../pyzipf'))
```

We will also change the "general configuration" section
to add `autodoc` to the list of Sphinx extensions we want:

```python
extensions = ['sphinx.ext.autodoc']
```

\newpage

With those edits complete,
we can now generate a Sphinx `autodoc` script
that generates information about each of our modules
and puts it in corresponding `.rst` files in the `docs/source` directory:

```bash
sphinx-apidoc -o source/ ../pyzipf
```

```text
Creating file source/collate.rst.
Creating file source/countwords.rst.
Creating file source/plotcounts.rst.
Creating file source/test_zipfs.rst.
Creating file source/utilities.rst.
Creating file source/modules.rst.
```

At this point, we are ready to generate our webpage.
The `docs` sub-directory contains a Makefile that was generated by `sphinx-quickstart`.
If we run `make html` and open `docs/_build/index.html` in a web browser,
we'll have a landing page with minimal documentation (FigureÂ \@ref(fig:packaging-sphinx-landing-page-original)).
If we click on the `Module Index` link we can access the documentation for the individual modules
(FiguresÂ \@ref(fig:packaging-sphinx-module-list) andÂ \@ref(fig:packaging-sphinx-module-countwords)).

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/packaging/landing-page-original.png" alt="The default website landing page." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:packaging-sphinx-landing-page-original)The default website landing page.</p>
</div>

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/packaging/module-index.png" alt="The module index." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:packaging-sphinx-module-list)The module index.</p>
</div>

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/packaging/module-countwords.png" alt="The countwords documentation." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:packaging-sphinx-module-countwords)The countwords documentation.</p>
</div>

The landing page for the website is the perfect place for the content of our README file,
so we can add the line `.. include:: ../README.rst` to the `docs/index.rst` file to insert it:

```markdown
Welcome to pyzipf's documentation!
==================================

.. include:: ../README.rst

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2
   :caption: Contents:

Indices and tables
==================

* :ref:`genindex`
* :ref:`modindex`
* :ref:`search`
```

If we re-run `make html`,
we now get an updated set of web pages that
re-uses our README as the introduction to the documentation (FigureÂ \@ref(fig:packaging-sphinx-landing-page)).

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/packaging/landing-page.png" alt="The new landing page showing the contents of README.rst." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:packaging-sphinx-landing-page)The new landing page showing the contents of README.rst.</p>
</div>

Before going on,
note that Sphinx is not included in the installation requirements in `requirements.txt` (SectionÂ \@ref(testing-ci)).
Sphinx isn't needed to run, develop, or even test our package,
but it is needed for building the documentation.
To note this requirement,
but without requiring everyone installing the package to install Sphinx,
let's create a `requirements_docs.txt` file that contains this line
(where the version number is found by running `pip freeze`):

```text
Sphinx>=1.7.4
```

Anyone wanting to build the documentation (including us, on another computer)
now only needs run `pip install -r requirements_docs.txt`

### Hosting documentation online {#packaging-rtd}

Now that we have generated our package documentation,
we need to host it online.
A common option for Python projects is [Read the Docs][readthedocs],\index{Read the Docs (for Python documentation)}
which is a community-supported site that hosts software documentation free of charge.

Just as continuous integration systems automatically re-test things (SectionÂ \@ref(testing-ci)),
Read the Docs integrates with GitHub
so that documentation is automatically re-built
every time updates are pushed to the project's GitHub repository.\index{continuous integration!for documentation}
If we register for Read the Docs with our GitHub account,
we can log in at the Read the Docs website and
import a project from our GitHub repository.
Read the Docs will then build the documentation
(using `make html` as we did earlier)
and host the resulting files.

For this to work,
all of the source files generated by Sphinx
need to be checked into your GitHub repository:
in our case,
this means `docs/source/*.rst`,
`docs/Makefile`,
`docs/conf.py`,
and `docs/index.rst`.
We also need to create and save a
[Read the Docs configuration file][readthedocs-config]
in the root directory of our `pyzipf` package:

```bash
$ cd ~/pyzipf
$ cat .readthedocs.yml
```

```text
# .readthedocs.yml
# Read the Docs configuration file
# See https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/config-file/v2.html
# for details

# Required
version: 2

# Build documentation in the docs/ directory with Sphinx
sphinx:
  configuration: docs/conf.py

# Optionally set the version of Python and requirements required
# to build your docs
python:
  version: 3.7
  install:
    - requirements: requirements.txt
```

The configuration file uses the now-familiar \gref{YAML}{yaml} format\index{YAML}
(SectionÂ \@ref(config-formats) and AppendixÂ \@ref(yaml))
to specify the location of the Sphinx configuration script (`docs/conf.py`)
and the dependencies for our package (`requirements.txt`).

Amira has gone through this process and the documentation is now available at:

<https://pyzipf.readthedocs.io/>

## Software Journals {#packaging-software-journals}

As a final step to releasing our new package,
we might want to give it a \gref{DOI}{doi}\index{DOI (Digital Object Identifier)}\index{Digital Object Identifier (DOI)}
so that it can be cited by researchers.
As we saw in SectionÂ \@ref(provenance-code-scripts),
GitHub [integrates with Zenodo][github-zenodo-tutorial]
for precisely this purpose.

While creating a DOI using a site like Zenodo
is often the end of the software publishing process,
there is the option of publishing
a journal paper to describe the software in detail.
Some research disciplines have journals devoted
to describing particular types of software
(e.g., [*Geoscientific Model Development*][geoscientific-model-development]),
and there are also a number of generic software journals such as the
[*Journal of Open Research Software*][jors] and
the [*Journal of Open Source Software*][theoj].
Packages submitted to these journals are typically assessed against a range of criteria
relating to how easy the software is to install
and how well it is documented,
so the peer review process can be a great way to get critical feedback
from people who have seen many research software packages come and go over the years.

Once you have obtained a DOI and possibly published with a software journal,
the last step is to tell users how to cite your new software package.
This is traditionally done by adding a `CITATION` file\index{CITATION file}\index{project files!CITATION}
to the associated GitHub repository
(alongside `README`, `LICENSE`, `CONDUCT` and similar files discussed in SectionÂ \@ref(getting-started-boilerplate)),
containing a plain text citation that can be copied and pasted into email
as well as entries formatted for various bibliographic systems like [BibTeX][bibtex].

```bash
$ cat CITATION.md
```

```text
# Citation

If you use the pyzipf package for work/research presented in a
publication, we ask that you please cite:

Khan A and Virtanen S, 2020. pyzipf: A Python package for word
count analysis. *Journal of Important Software*, 5(51), 2317,
https://doi.org/10.21105/jois.02317

### BibTeX entry

@article{Khan2020,
    title={pyzipf: A Python package for word count analysis.},
    author={Khan, Amira and Virtanen, Sami},
    journal={Journal of Important Software},
    volume={5},
    number={51},

}
```

## Summary {#packaging-summary}

Thousands of people have helped write the software that our Zipf's Law example relies on,
but their work is only useful because they packaged it
and documented how to use it.
Doing this is increasingly recognized as a credit-worthy activity
by universities, government labs, and other organizations,
particularly for research software engineers.
It is also deeply satisfying to make strangers' lives better,
if only in small ways.

## Exercises

### Package metadata {#packaging-ex-metadata}

In a number of places on our TestPyPI webpage,
it says that no project description was provided (Figure \@ref(fig:packaging-testpypi)).
How could we edit our `setup.py` file to include a description?
What other metadata would you add?

Hint: The [`setup() args` documentation][setuptools-setup-args] might be useful.

### Separating requirements {#packaging-ex-separating-requirements}

As well as `requirements_docs.txt`,
developers often create a `requirements_dev.txt` file
to list packages that are not needed by the package's users,
but are required for its development and testing.
Pull `pytest` out of `requirements.txt` and put it in a new `requirements_dev.txt` file.

### Software review {#packaging-ex-software-review}

The [*Journal of Open Source Software*][theoj] has a [checklist][theoj-checklist]
that reviewers must follow when assessing a submitted software paper.
Run through the checklist (skipping the criteria related to the software paper)
and see how the Zipf's Law package would rate on each criteria.

### Packaging quotations {#packaging-ex-pratchett}

Each chapter in this book opens with a quote from the British author Terry Pratchett.
This script `quotes.py` contains a function `random_quote` which prints a random Pratchett quote:

```python
import random


quote_list = ["It's still magic even if you know how it's done.",
              "Everything starts somewhere, "\
              "though many physicists disagree.",
              "Ninety percent of most magic merely consists "\
              "of knowing one extra fact.",
              "Wisdom comes from experience. "\
              "Experience is often a result of lack of wisdom.",
              "There isn't a way things should be. "\
              "There's just what happens, and what we do.",
              "Multiple exclamation marks are a sure sign "\
              "of a diseased mind.",
              "+++ Divide By Cucumber Error. "\
              "Please Reinstall Universe And Reboot +++",
              "It's got three keyboards and a hundred extra "\
              "knobs, including twelve with â?' on them.",
             ]


def random_quote():
    """Print a random Pratchett quote."""
    print(random.choice(quote_list))
```

Create a new `conda` development environment called `pratchett`
and use `pip` to install a new package called `pratchett` into that environment.
The package should contain `quotes.py`,
and once the package has been installed the user should be able to run:

```python
from pratchett import quotes


quotes.random_quote()
```

## Key Points {#packaging-keypoints}


-   Use [`setuptools`][setuptools] to build and distribute Python packages.
-   Create a directory named `mypackage` containing a `setup.py` script with a subdirectory also called `mypackage` containing the package's source files.
-   Use \gref{semantic versioning}{semantic_versioning} for software releases.
-   Use a \gref{virtual environment}{virtual_environment} to test how your package installs without disrupting your main Python installation.
-   Use [`pip`][pip] to install Python packages.
-   The default repository for Python packages is [PyPI][pypi].
-   Use [TestPyPI][testpypi] to test the distribution of your package.
-   Use a README file for package-level documentation.
-   Use [Sphinx][sphinx] to generate documentation for a package.
-   Use [Read the Docs][readthedocs] to host package documentation online.
-   Create a \gref{DOI}{doi} for your package using [GitHub's Zenodo integration][github-zenodo-tutorial].
-   Publish details of your package in a software journal so others can cite it.

# Finale {#finale}

We have come a long way since we first met Amira, Jun, and Sami in SectionÂ \@ref(intro-personas).
Amira now has her scripts, datasets and reports organized,
in version control,
and on GitHub.
Her work has already paid off:
a colleague spotted a problem in an analysis step,
that impacted five figures in one of her reports.
Because Amira has embraced GitHub,
the colleague could easily suggest a fix through a pull request.
It took Amira some time to regenerate all of the
affected figures, because she had to recall
which code needed to be rerun.
She recognized this as a great reason to embrace Make,
and has added implementing it to her to-do list.

She used to be intimidated by the Unix shell,
but now Amira finds it an essential part of her everyday work:
she uses shell scripts to automate data processing tasks,
she runs her own command-line tools she wrote in Python,
and issues countless commands to Git.
Her comfort with the shell is also helping
as she learns how to run her analyses on a remote computing cluster
from Sami.

Sami had experience with Git and Make in software projects from
their undergraduate studies,
but they have a new appreciation for their importance in research projects.
They've reworked their Git and Make workshops to use examples of data pipelines,
and have been getting rave reviews from participants.
Sami has also gained an appreciation
for the importance of provenance
of both data and code in research.
They've been helping their users
by suggesting ways they can make their research more accessible, inspectable and reproducible.

Jun is now working on his first Python package.
He's added better error handling so he and his
users get better information when something goes wrong,
he's implemented some testing strategies to give him and his users confidence that his code works, and
he's improved his documentation.
Jun has also added a license, a Code of Conduct and contributing guidelines to his project repo,
and has already had a contribution that fixes some typos in the documentation.

## Why We Wrote This Book

Shell scripts,
branching,
automated workflows,
healthy team dynamics---they all take time to learn,
but they enable researchers to get more done in less time and with less pain,
and that's why we wrote this book.
The climate crisis is the greatest threat our species has faced since civilization began.
The COVID-19 pandemic has shown just how ill-prepared we are to deal with problems of that magnitude,
or with the suspicion and disinformation that now poisons every public discussion online.

Every hour that a researcher *doesn't* waste wrestling with software
is an hour they can spend solving a new problem;
every meeting that ends early with a clear decision
frees up time to explain to the public what we actually know and why it matters.
We don't expect this book to change the world,
but we hope that knowing how to write, test, document, package, and share your work
will give you a slightly better chance of doing so.
We hope you have enjoyed reading what we have written;
if so,
we would enjoy hearing from you.

# Solutions {#solutions}

The exercises included in this book represent a wide variety of problems,
from multiple choice questions to larger coding tasks.
It's relatively straightforward to indicate a correct answer for the former,
though there may be unanticipated cases in which the specific software version
you're using leads to alternative answers being preferable.
It's even more difficult to identify the "right" answer for the latter,
since there are often many ways to accomplish the same task with code.
Here we present possible solutions that the authors generally agree represent "good" code,
but we encourage you to explore additional approaches.

Commits noted in a solution reference [Amira's `zipf` repository on GitHub][amira-repo],
which allow you to see the specific lines of a file modified to arrive at the answer.

## ChapterÂ \@ref(bash-basics) {.unnumbered .unlisted}

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-basics-ex-more-ls) {-}

The `-l` option makes `ls` use a **l**ong listing format, showing not only
the file/directory names but also additional information such as the file size
and the time of its last modification. If you use both the `-h` option and the `-l` option,
this makes the file size "**h**uman readable", i.e., displaying something like `5.3K`
instead of `5369`.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-basics-ex-ls-rt) {-}

The command `ls -R -t` results in the contents of 
each directory sorted by time of last change.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-basics-ex-paths) {-}

1. No: `.` stands for the current directory.
2. No: `/` stands for the root directory.
3. No: Amira's home directory is `/Users/Amira`.
4. No: This goes up two levels, i.e., ends in `/Users`.
5. Yes: `~` stands for the user's home directory, in this case `/Users/amira`.
6. No: This would navigate into a directory `home` in the current directory if it exists.
7. Yes: Starting from the home directory `~`, this command goes into `data` then back (using `..`) to the home directory.
8. Yes: Shortcut to go back to the user's home directory.
9. Yes: Goes up one level.
10. Yes: Same as the previous answer, but with an unnecessary `.` (indicating the current directory).

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-basics-ex-resolve-rel-path) {-}

1. No: There *is* a directory `backup` in `/Users`.
2. No: This is the content of `Users/sami/backup`,
   but with `..` we asked for one level further up.
3. No: Same as previous explanation, but results shown as directories
   (which is what the `-F` option specifies).
4. Yes: `../backup/` refers to `/Users/backup/`.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-basics-ex-reading-ls) {-}

 1. No: `pwd` is not the name of a directory.
 2. Yes: `ls` without directory argument lists files and directories
    in the current directory.
 3. Yes: Uses the absolute path explicitly.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-basics-ex-touch) {-}

The `touch` command updates a file's timestamp.
If no file exists with the given name, `touch` will create one.
Assuming you don't already have `my_file.txt` in your working directory,
`touch my_file.txt` will create the file.
When you inspect the file with `ls -l`, note that the size of
`my_file.txt` is 0 bytes.  In other words, it contains no data.
If you open `my_file.txt` using your text editor, it is blank.

\newpage

Some programs do not generate output files themselves, but
instead require that empty files have already been generated.
When the program is run, it searches for an existing file to
populate with its output.  The touch command allows you to
efficiently generate a blank text file to be used by such
programs.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-basics-ex-safe-rm) {-}

```bash
$ remove my_file.txt? y
```

The `-i` option will prompt before (every) removal
(use <kbd>y</kbd> to confirm deletion or <kbd>n</kbd> to keep the file).
The Unix shell doesn't have a trash bin, so all the files removed will disappear forever.
By using the `-i` option, we have the chance to check that we are deleting
only the files that we want to remove.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-basics-ex-move-dot) {-}

```bash
$ mv ../data/chapter1.txt ../data/chapter2.txt .
```

Recall that `..` refers to the parent directory (i.e., one above the current directory)
and that `.` refers to the current directory.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-basics-ex-renaming-files) {-}

1. No: While this would create a file with the correct name,
the incorrectly named file still exists in the directory and would need to be deleted.
2. Yes: This would work to rename the file.
3. No: The period (`.`) indicates where to move the file, but does not provide a new filename;
identical filenames cannot be created.
4. No: The period (`.`) indicates where to copy the file, but does not provide a new filename;
identical filenames cannot be created.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-basics-ex-last-ls) {-}

We start in the `/Users/amira/data` directory, 
containing a single file, `books.dat`.
We create a new folder called `doc`
and move (`mv`) the file `books.dat` to that new folder.
Then we make a copy (`cp`) of the file we just moved named `books-saved.dat`.  

The tricky part here is the location of the copied file.
Recall that `..` means "go up a level," so the copied file is now in `/Users/amira`.
Notice that `..` is interpreted with respect to the current working
directory, **not** with respect to the location of the file being copied.
So, the only thing that will show using ls (in `/Users/amira/data`) is the `doc` folder.

1. No: `books-saved.dat` is located at `/Users/amira`
2. Yes.
3. No: `books.dat` is located at `/Users/amira/data/doc`
4. No: `books-saved.dat` is located at `/Users/amira`

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-basics-ex-copy-multi) {-}

If given more than one filename followed by a directory name (i.e., the destination directory must
be the last argument), `cp` copies the files to the named directory.

If given three filenames, 
`cp` throws an error because it is expecting a directory name as the last argument.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-basics-ex-ls-match) {-}

1. Yes: Shows all files whose names contain two different characters (`?`) 
followed by the letter `n`,
then zero or more characters (`*`) followed by `txt`.

2. No: Shows all files whose names start with zero or more characters (`*`) 
followed by `e_`,
zero or more characters (`*`), 
then `txt`. 
The output includes the two desired books, but also `time_machine.txt`.

3. No: Shows all files whose names start with zero or more characters (`*`) 
followed by `n`,
zero or more characters (`*`), 
then `txt`. 
The output includes the two desired books, 
but also `frankenstein.txt` and `time_machine.txt`.

4. No: Shows all files whose names start with zero or more characters (`*`) 
followed by `n`,
a single character `?`,
`e`,
zero or more characters (`*`), 
then `txt`. 
The output shows `frankenstein.txt` and `sense_and_sensibility.txt`.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-basics-ex-organizing) {-}

```bash
$ mv *.txt data
```

Amira needs to move her files `books.txt` and `titles.txt` to the `data` directory.
The shell will expand `*.txt` to match all `.txt` files in the current directory.
The `mv` command then moves the list of `.txt` files to the `data` directory.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-basics-ex-reproduce-structure) {-}

1. Yes: This accurately re-creates the directory structure.

2. Yes: This accurately re-creates the directory structure.

3. No: The first line of this code set gives an error:

   ```text
   mkdir: 2016-05-20/data: No such file or directory
   ```
   `mkdir` won't create a subdirectory for a directory that doesn't yet exist 
   (unless you use an option like `-p` that explicitly creates parent directories).

4. No: This creates `raw` and `processed` directories at the same level as `data`:

   ```text
   2016-05-20/
       âââ data
       âââ processed
       âââ raw
   ```

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-basics-ex-wildcard-expressions) {-}

1. A solution using two wildcard expressions:

    ```bash
    $ ls s*.txt
    $ ls t*.txt
    ```

2. When there are no files beginning with `s` and ending in `.txt`, 
or when there are no files beginning with `t` and ending in `.txt`. 


### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-basics-ex-remove-unneeded) {-}

1. No: This would remove only `.csv` files with one-character names.
2. Yes: This removes only files ending in `.csv`.
3. No: The shell would expand `*` to match everything in the current directory,
so the command would try to remove all matched files and an additional
file called `.csv`.
4. No: The shell would expand `*.*` to match all files with any extension,
so this command would delete all files in the current directory.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-basics-ex-other-wildcards) {-}

`novel-????-[ab]*.{txt,pdf}` matches:

-   Files whose names start with `novel-`,
-   which is then followed by exactly four characters
    (since each `?` matches one character),
-   followed by another literal `-`,
-   followed by either the letter `a` or the letter `b`,
-   followed by zero or more other characters (the `*`),
-   followed by `.txt` or `.pdf`.

## ChapterÂ \@ref(bash-tools) {.unnumbered .unlisted}

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-tools-ex-redirect-append) {-}

`echo hello > testfile01.txt` writes the string "hello" to `testfile01.txt`,
but the file gets overwritten each time we run the command.

`echo hello >> testfile02.txt` writes "hello" to `testfile02.txt`,
but appends the string to the file if it already exists (i.e., when we run it for the second time).

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-tools-ex-append-data) {-}

1. No: This results from only running the first line of code (`head`).
2. No: This results from only running the second line of code (`tail`).
3. Yes: The first line writes the first three lines of `dracula.txt`,
the second line appends the last two lines of `dracula.txt` to the same file.
4. No: We would need to pipe the commands to obtain this answer (`head -n 3 dracula.txt | tail -n 2 > extracted.txt`).

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-tools-ex-piping) {-}

Try running each line of code in the `data` directory.

1. No: This incorrectly uses redirect (`>`), 
and will result in an error.
2. No: The number of lines desired for `head` is reported incorrectly;
this will result in an error.
3. No: This will extract the first three files from the `wc` results,
which have not yet been sorted into length of lines.
4. Yes: This output correctly orders and connects each of the commands.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-tools-ex-uniq-adjacent) {-}

To obtain a list of unique results from these data,
we need to run:

```bash
$ sort genres.txt | uniq
```

It makes sense that `uniq` is almost always run after using `sort`,
because that allows a computer to compare only adjacent lines.
If `uniq` did not compare only adjacent lines,
it would require comparing each line to all other lines.
For a small set of comparisons,
this doesn't matter much,
but this isn't always possible for large files.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-tools-ex-reading-pipes) {-}

When used on a single file,
`cat` prints the contents of that file to the screen.
In this case,
the contents of `titles.txt` are sent as input to `head -n 5`,
so the first five lines of `titles.txt` is output.
These five lines are used as the input for `tail -n 3`,
which results in lines 3--5 as output.
This is used as input to the final command,
which sorts them in reverse order.
These results are written to the file `final.txt`,
the contents of which are:

```text
Sense and Sensibility,1811
Moby Dick,1851
Jane Eyre,1847
```

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-tools-ex-pipe-construction) {-}

`cut` selects substrings from a line by:

-   breaking the string into pieces wherever it finds a separator (`-d ,`),
which in this case is a comma, and
-   keeping one or more of the resulting fields/columns (`-f 2`).

In this case, 
the output is only the dates from `titles.txt`,
since this is in the second column.

```bash
$ cut -d , -f 2 titles.txt
```

```text
1897
1818
1847
1851
1811
1892
1897
1895
1847
```

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-tools-ex-which-pipe) {-}

1. No: This sorts by the book title.
2. No: This results in an error because `sort` is being used incorrectly.
3. No: There are duplicate dates in the output because they have not been sorted first.
4. Yes: This results in the output shown below.
5. No: This extracts the desired data (below), 
but then counts the number of lines,
resulting in the incorrect answer.

```text
   1 1811
   1 1818
   2 1847
   1 1851
   1 1892
   1 1895
   2 1897
```

If you have difficulty understanding the answers above,
try running the commands or sub-sections of the pipelines
(e.g., the code between pipes).

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-tools-ex-loop-dry-run) {-}

The difference between the versions is whether the code after `echo`
is inside quotation marks.

The first version redirects the output from `echo analyze $file` 
to a file (`analyzed-$file`). 
This doesn't allow us to preview the commands,
but instead creates files (`analyzed-$file`)
containing the text `analyze $file`.

The second version will allow us to preview the commands.
This prints to screen everything enclosed in the quotation marks,
expanding the loop variable name (prefixed with `$`).

Try both versions for yourself to see the output. Be sure to open the
`analyzed-*` files to view their contents.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-tools-ex-loop-variables) {-}

The first version gives the same output on each iteration through
the loop.
Bash expands the wildcard `*.txt` to match all files ending in `.txt`
and then lists them using `ls`.
The expanded loop would look like this
(we'll only show the first two data files):

```bash
$ for datafile in dracula.txt  frankenstein.txt ...
> do
>	ls dracula.txt  frankenstein.txt ...
```

```text
dracula.txt  frankenstein.txt ...
dracula.txt  frankenstein.txt ...
...
```

The second version lists a different file on each loop iteration.
The value of the `datafile` variable is evaluated using `$datafile`,
and then listed using `ls`.

```text
dracula.txt
frankenstein.txt
jane_eyre.txt
moby_dick.txt
sense_and_sensibility.txt
sherlock_holmes.txt
time_machine.txt
```

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-tools-ex-limiting-file-sets) {-}

The first version results in only `dracula.txt` output, 
because it is the only file beginning in "d".

The second version results in the following,
because these files all contain a "d" with zero or more characters before and after:

```text
README.md
dracula.txt
moby_dick.txt
sense_and_sensibility.txt
```

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-tools-ex-loop-save) {-}

Both versions write the first 16 lines (`head -n 16`) 
of each book to a file (`headers.txt`).

The first version results in the text from each file being overwritten in each iteration
because of use of `>` as a redirect.

The second version uses `>>`,
which appends the lines to the existing file.
This is preferable because the final `headers.txt` 
includes the first 16 lines from all files.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-tools-ex-history-order) {-}

If a command causes something to crash or hang, it might be useful
to know what that command was, in order to investigate the problem.
Were the command only be recorded after running it, we would not
have a record of the last command run in the event of a crash.

## ChapterÂ \@ref(bash-advanced) {.unnumbered .unlisted}

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-advanced-ex-cleaning-up) {-}

```bash
$ cd ~/zipf
```
Change into the `zipf` directory,
which is located in the home directory (designated by `~`).

```bash
$ for file in $(find . -name "*.bak")
> do
>   rm $file
> done
```
Find all the files ending in `.bak` and remove them one by one.

```bash
$ rm bin/summarize_all_books.sh
```
Remove the `summarize_all_books.sh` script.

```bash
$ rm -r results
```
Recursively remove each file in the `results` directory
and then remove the directory itself.
(It is necessary to remove all the files first because you
cannot remove a non-empty directory.)

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-advanced-ex-script-variables) {-}

Running this script with the given parameters will print
the first and last line from each file in the directory ending in `.txt`.

1. No: This answer misinterprets the lines printed.
2. Yes.
3. No: This answer includes the wrong files.
4. No: Leaving off the quotation marks would result in an error.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-advanced-ex-longest-with-extension) {-}

One possible script (`longest.sh`) to accomplish this task:

```bash
# Shell script which takes two arguments:
#    1. a directory name
#    2. a file extension
# and prints the name of the file in that directory
# with the most lines which matches the file extension.
#
# Usage: bash longest.sh directory/ txt

wc -l $1/*.$2 | sort -n | tail -n 2 | head -n 1
```

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-advanced-ex-reading-scripts) {-}

1. `script1.sh` will print the names of all files in the directory on a single line,
e.g., `README.md dracula.txt frankenstein.txt jane_eyre.txt moby_dick.txt script1.sh sense_and_sensibility.txt sherlock_holmes.txt time_machine.txt`.
Although `*.txt` is included when running the script,
the commands run by the script do not reference `$1`.
2. `script2.sh` will print the contents of the first three files ending in `.txt`;
the three variables (`$1`, `$2`, `$3`) refer to the first, second, and third argument
entered after the script, respectively.
3. `script3.sh` will print the name of each file ending in `.txt`,
since `$@` refers to *all* the arguments (e.g., filenames) given to a shell script.
The list of files would be followed by `.txt`:
`dracula.txt frankenstein.txt jane_eyre.txt moby_dick.txt sense_and_sensibility.txt sherlock_holmes.txt time_machine.txt.txt`.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-advanced-ex-using-grep) {-}

1. No: This command extracts any line containing "he", 
either as a word or within a word.
2. No: This results in the same output as the answer for #1.
`-E` allows the search term to represent an extended regular expression,
but the search term is simple enough that it doesn't make a difference in the result.
3. Yes: `-w` means to return only matches for the word "he".
4. No: `-i` means to invert the search result;
this would return all lines *except* the one we desire.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-advanced-ex-year-script) {-}

```bash
# Obtain unique years from multiple comma-delimited
# lists of titles and publication years
#
# Usage: bash year.sh file1.txt file2.txt ...

for filename in $*
do
  cut -d , -f 2 $filename | sort -n | uniq
done
```

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-advanced-ex-sense-sensibility) {-}

One possible solution:

```bash
for sister in Elinor Marianne
do
	echo $sister:
	grep -o -w $sister sense_and_sensibility.txt | wc -l
done
```

The `-o` option prints only the matching part of a line.

An alternative (but possibly less accurate)
solution is:

```bash
for sister in Elinor Marianne
do
	echo $sister:
	grep -o -c -w $sister sense_and_sensibility.txt
done
```

This solution is potentially less accurate
because `grep -c` only reports the number of lines matched.
The total number of matches reported by this method
will be lower if there is more than one match per line.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-advanced-ex-match-subtract) {-}

1. Yes: This returns `data/jane_eyre.txt`.
2. Maybe: This option may work on your computer,
but may not behave consistently across all shells 
because expansion of the wildcard (`*e.txt`) may prevent piping from working correctly.
We recommend enclosing `*e.txt` in quotation marks,
as in answer 1.
3. No: This searches the contents of files for lines matching "machine",
rather than the filenames.
4. See above.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-advanced-ex-reading-find) {-}

1. Find all files with a `.dat` extension recursively from the current directory.
2. Count the number of lines each of these files contains.
3. Sort the output from step 2 numerically.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(bash-advanced-ex-find-tests) {-}

The following command works if your working directory is `Desktop/`
and you replace "username" with that of your current computer.
`-mtime` needs to be negative because it is referencing a day prior to the current date.

```bash
$ find . -type f -mtime -1 -user username
```

## ChapterÂ \@ref(scripting) {.unnumbered .unlisted}

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(scripting-ex-command-line) {-}

Running a Python statement directly from the command line is useful as a basic calculator
and for simple string operations,
since these commands occur in one line of code.
More complicated commands will require multiple statements;
when run using `python -c`,
statements must be separated by semi-colons:

```python
$ python -c "import math; print(math.log(123))"
```

Multiple statements,
therefore,
quickly become more troublesome to run in this manner.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(scripting-ex-glob-ls) {-}

The `my_ls.py` script could read as follows:

```python
"""List the files in a given directory with a given suffix."""

import argparse

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(scripting-ex-better-plotting) {-}

While there may be other ways for `plotcounts.py` 
to meet the requirements of the exercise,
we'll be using this script in subsequent chapters so
we recommend that the script reads as follows:

```python

import pandas as pd


def main(args):
    """Run the command line program."""
    df = pd.read_csv(args.infile, header=None,

## ChapterÂ \@ref(git-cmdline) {.unnumbered .unlisted}

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(git-cmdline-ex-places) {-}

Amira does not need to make the `heaps-law` subdirectory a Git repository
because the `zipf` repository will track everything inside it regardless of how deeply nested.

Amira *shouldn't* run `git init` in `heaps-law` because nested Git repositories can interfere with each other.
If someone commits something in the inner repository,
Git will not know whether to record the changes in that repository,
the outer one,
or both.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(git-cmdline-ex-unsave) {-}

`git status` now shows:

```text
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	example.txt

nothing added to commit but untracked files present
(use "git add" to track)
```

Nothing has happened to the file;
it still exists but Git no longer has it in the staging area.
`git rm --cached` is equivalent to `git restore --staged`.
With newer versions of Git,
older commands will still work,
and you may encounter references to them when reading help documentation.
If you created this file in your `zipf` project,
we recommend removing it before proceeding.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(git-cmdline-ex-word-diff) {-}

If we make a few changes to `.gitignore` such that it now reads:

```text
__pycache__ this is a change

this is another change

```

Depending on the nature of the changes you are viewing,
the latter may be easier to interpret 
since it shows exactly what has been
changed.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(git-cmdline-ex-commit) {-}

1.  Maybe: would only create a commit if the file has already been staged.
2.  No: would try to create a new repository,
which results in an error if a repository already exists.
3.  Yes: first adds the file to the staging area, then commits.
4.  No: would result in an error,
as it would try to commit a file "my recent changes" with the message "myfile.txt."

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(git-cmdline-ex-bio) {-}

1.  Go into your home directory with `cd ~`.
2.  Create a new folder called `bio` with `mkdir bio`.
3.  Make the repository your working directory with `cd bio`.
4.  Turn it into a repository with `git init`.
5.  Create your biography using `nano` or another text editor.
6.  Add it and commit it in a single step with `git commit -a -m "Some message"`.
7.  Modify the file.
8.  Use `git diff` to see the differences.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(git-cmdline-ex-multiple) {-}

1.  Create `employment.txt` using an editor like Nano.
2.  Add both `me.txt` and `employment.txt` to the staging area with `git add *.txt`.
3.  Check that both files are there with `git status`.
4.  Commit both files at once with `git commit`.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(git-cmdline-ex-timestamp) {-}

GitHub displays timestamps in a human-readable relative format
(i.e., "22 hours ago" or "three weeks ago"),
since this makes it easy for anyone in any time zone
to know what changes have been made recently.
However, if we hover over the timestamp
we can see the exact time at which the last change to the file occurred.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(git-cmdline-ex-history) {-}

The answer is 1.

The command `git add motivation.txt` adds the current version of `motivation.txt` to the staging area.
The changes to the file from the second `echo` command are only applied to the working copy,
not the version in the staging area.

As a result,
when `git commit -m "Motivate project"` is executed,
the version of `motivation.txt` committed to the repository is the content from the first `echo`.

However,
the working copy still has the output from the second `echo`;
`git status` would show that the file is modified.
`git restore HEAD motivation.txt` therefore replaces the working copy with
the most recently committed version of `motivation.txt`
(the content of the first `echo`),
so `cat motivation.txt` prints:

```text
Zipf's Law describes the relationship between the frequency and
rarity of words.
```

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(git-cmdline-ex-ignore-nested) {-}

Add this line to `.gitignore`:

```text
results/plots/
```

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(git-cmdline-ex-include) {-}

Add the following two lines to `.gitignore`:

```text
*.dat           # ignore all data files
!final.dat      # except final.data
```

The exclamation point `!` includes a previously excluded entry.

Note also that if we have previously committed `.dat` files in this repository,
they will not be ignored once these rules are added to `.gitignore`.
Only future `.dat` files will be ignored.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(git-cmdline-ex-github-interface) {-}

The left button (with the picture of a clipboard)
copies the full identifier of the commit to the clipboard.
In the shell,
`git log` shows the full commit identifier for each commit.

The middle button (with seven letters and numbers)
shows all of the changes that were made in that particular commit;
green shaded lines indicate additions and red lines indicate removals.
We can show the same thing in the shell using `git diff`
or `git diff FROM..TO`
(where `FROM` and `TO` are commit identifiers).

The right button lets us view all of the files in the repository at the time of that commit.
To do this in the shell,
we would need to check out the repository as it was at that commit
using `git checkout ID`, where `ID` is the tag, branch name, or commit identifier.
If we do this,
we need to remember to put the repository back to the right state afterward.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(git-cmdline-ex-push-commit) {-}

Committing updates our local repository.
Pushing sends any commits we have made locally
that aren't yet in the remote repository
to the remote repository.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(git-cmdline-ex-boilerplate) {-}

When GitHub creates a `README.md` file while setting up a new repository,
it actually creates the repository and then commits the `README.md` file.
When we try to pull from the remote repository to our local repository,
Git detects that their histories do not share a common origin and refuses to merge them.

```bash
$ git pull origin master
```

```text
warning: no common commits
remote: Enumerating objects: 3, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
remote: Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
From https://github.com/frances/eniac
 * branch            master     -> FETCH_HEAD
 * [new branch]      master     -> origin/master
fatal: refusing to merge unrelated histories
```

We can force Git to merge the two repositories with the option `--allow-unrelated-histories`.
Please check the contents of the local and remote repositories carefully before doing this.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(git-cmdline-ex-recover) {-}

The `checkout` command restores files from the repository,
overwriting the files in our working directory.
`HEAD` indicates the latest version.

1. No: this can be dangerous;
without a filename,
`git checkout` will restore all files in the current directory (and all directories below it)
to their state at the commit specified.
This command will restore `data_cruncher.sh` to the latest commit version,
but will also reset any other files we have changed to that version,
which will erase any unsaved changes you may have made to those files.
2. Yes: this restores the latest version of only the desired file.
3. No: this gets the version of `data_cruncher.sh` from the commit before `HEAD`,
which is not what we want.
4. Yes: the unique ID (identifier) of the last commit is what `HEAD` means.
5. Yes: this is equivalent to the answer to 2.
6. No: `git restore` assumes `HEAD`,
so Git will assume you're trying to restore a file called `HEAD`,
resulting in an error.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(git-cmdline-ex-diff) {-}

1. Compares what has changed between the
current `bin/plotcounts.py` and the same file nine commits ago.
2.  It returns an error: 
`fatal: ambiguous argument 'HEAD~9': unknown revision or path not in the working tree.`
We don't have enough commits in history for the command to properly execute.
3.  It compares changes (either staged or unstaged)
to the most recent commit.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(git-cmdline-ex-unstage) {-}

No, using `git checkout` on a staged file does not unstage it.
The changes are in the staging area and checkout would affect
the working directory.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(git-cmdline-ex-blame) {-}

Each line of output corresponds to a line in the file, 
and includes the commit identifier,
who last modified the line,
when that change was made,
and what is included on that line.
Note that the edit you just committed is not present here;
`git blame` only shows the current lines in the file,
and doesn't report on lines that have been removed.

## ChapterÂ \@ref(git-advanced) {.unnumbered .unlisted}

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(git-advanced-ex-explain-options) {-}

1.  `--oneline` shows each commit on a single line
    with the \gref{short identifier}{short_identifier_git} at the start
    and the title of the commit beside it.
    `-n NUMBER` limits the number of commits to show.

2.  `--since` and `--after` can be used to show commits
    in a range of dates or times;
    `--author` can be used to show commits by a particular person;
    and `-w` tells Git to ignore whitespace when comparing commits.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(git-advanced-ex-modify-prompt) {-}

An online search for "show Git branch in Bash prompt" turns up several approaches,
one of the simplest of which is to add this line to our `~/.bashrc` file:

```text
export PS1="\\w + \$(git branch 2>/dev/null | grep '^*' |
colrm 1 2) \$ "
```

Breaking it down:

1.  Setting the `PS1` variable defines the primary shell \gref{prompt}{prompt}.

1.  `\\w` in a shell prompt string means "the current directory."

1.  The `+` is a literal `+` sign between the current directory and the Git branch name.

1.  The command that gets the name of the current Git branch is in `$(...)`.
    (We need to escape the `$` as `\$` so Bash doesn't just run it once
    when defining the string.)

1.  The `git branch` command shows *all* the branches,
    so we pipe that to `grep` and select the one marked with a `*`.

1.  Finally, we remove the first column (i.e., the one containing the `*`)
    to leave just the branch name.

So what's `2>/dev/null` about?
That redirects any error messages to `/dev/null`,
a special "file" that consumes input without saving it.
We need that because sometimes we will be in a directory
that isn't inside a Git repository,
and we don't want error messages showing up in our shell prompt.

*None of this is obvious,*
and we didn't figure it out ourselves.
Instead,
we did a search and pasted various answers into [explainshell.com][explainshell]
until we had something we understood and trusted.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(git-advanced-ex-ignoring-files) {-}

<https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore>
ignores 76 files or patterns.
Of those,
we recognized less than half.
Searching online for some of these,
like `"*.pot file"`,
turns up useful explanations.
Searching for others like `var/` does not;
in that case,
we have to look at the category (in this case, "Python distribution")
and set aside time to do more reading.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(git-advanced-ex-create-twice) {-}

1.  `git diff master..same` does not print anything
    because there are no differences between the two branches.

2.  `git merge same master` prints `merging`
    because Git combines histories even when the files themselves do not differ.
    After running this command,
    `git history` shows a commit for the merge.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(git-advanced-ex-delete-unmerged) {-}

1.  Git refuses to delete a branch with unmerged commits
    because it doesn't want to destroy our work.

2.  Using the `-D` (capital-D) option to `git branch` will delete the branch anyway.
    This is dangerous because any content that exists only in that branch will be lost.

3.  Even with `-D`, `git branch` will not delete the branch we are currently on.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(git-advanced-ex-trace-changes) {-}

1.  Chartreuse has repositories on GitHub and their desktop
    containing identical copies of `README.md` and nothing else.
2.  Fuchsia has repositories on GitHub and their desktop
    with exactly the same content as Chartreuse's repositories.
3.  `fuchsia.txt` is in both of Fuchsia's repositories
    but not in Chartreuse's repositories.
4.  `fuchsia.txt` is still in both of Fuchsia's repositories
    but still not in Chartreuse's repositories.
5.  `chartreuse.txt` is in both of Chartreuse's repositories
    but not yet in either of Fuchsia's repositories.
6.  `chartreuse.txt` is in Fuchsia's desktop repository
    but not yet in their GitHub repository.
7.  `chartreuse.txt` is in both of Fuchsia's repositories.
8.  `fuchsia.txt` is in Chartreuse's GitHub repository
    but not in their desktop repository.
9.  All four repositories contain both `fuchsia.txt` and `chartreuse.txt`.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(teams-ex-boilerplate-coc) {-}

The `CONDUCT.md` file should have contents that mimic those given in SectionÂ \@ref(teams-coc).

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(teams-ex-boilerplate-license) {-}

The newly created `LICENSE.md` should look something like the example
MIT License shown in Section \@ref(teams-license-software).

```

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(teams-ex-file-issue) {-}

Be sure to tag the new issue as a feature request to help \gref{triage}{triage}.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(teams-ex-label) {-}

We often delete the `duplicate` label:
when we mark an issue that way,
we (almost) always add a comment saying which issue it's a duplicate *of*,
in which case it's just as sensible to label the issue `wontfix`.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(teams-ex-balancing) {-}

Some solutions could be:

- Give the team member their own office space so they don't distract others.
- Buy noise-cancelling headphones for the employees that find it distracting.
- Re-arrange the work spaces so that there is a "quiet office" and a regular
office space and have the team member with the attention disorder work
in the regular office.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(teams-ex-invisible) {-}

Possible solutions:

- Change the rule so that anyone who contributes to the project, in any way,
gets included as a co-author.
- Update the rule to include a contributor list on all projects with descriptions
of duties, roles, and tasks the contributor provided for the project.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(teams-ex-members) {-}

We obviously can't say which description fits you best, but:

-   Use \gref{three sticky notes}{three_stickies}
    and \gref{interruption bingo}{interruption_bingo}
    to stop *Anna* from cutting people off.

-   Tell *Bao* that the devil doesn't need more advocates,
    and that he's only allowed one "but what about" at a time.

-   *Hediyeh*'s lack of self-confidence will take a long time to remedy.
    Keeping a list of the times she's been right
    and reminding her of them frequently is a start,
    but the real fix is to create and maintain a supportive environment.

-   Unmasking *Kenny*'s hitchhiking will feel like nit-picking,
    but so does the accounting required to pin down other forms of fraud.
    The most important thing is to have the discussion in the open
    so that everyone realizes he's taking credit for everyone else's work
    as well as theirs.

-   *Melissa* needs a running partner---someone to work beside her
    so that she starts when she should and doesn't get distracted.
    If that doesn't work,
    the project may need to assign everything mission-critical to someone else
    (which will probably lead to her leaving).

-   *Petra* can be managed with a one-for-one rule:
    each time she builds or fixes something that someone else needs,
    she can then work on something she thinks is cool.
    However,
    she's only allowed to add whatever it is to the project
    if someone else will publicly commit to maintaining it.

-   Get *Frank* and *Raj* off your project as quickly as you can.

## ChapterÂ \@ref(automate) {.unnumbered .unlisted}

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(automate-ex-report-change) {-}

`make -n target` will show commands without running them.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(automate-ex-useful-options) {-}

1.  The `-B` option rebuilds everything, even files that aren't out of date.

2.  The `-C` option tells Make to change directories before executing,
    so that `make -C ~/myproject` runs Make in `~/myproject`
    regardless of the directory it is invoked from.

3.  By default, Make looks for (and runs) a file called `Makefile` or `makefile`.
    If you use another name for your Makefile
    (which is necessary if you have multiple Makefiles in the same directory),
    then you need to specify the name of that Makefile using the `-f` option.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(automate-ex-mkdir) {-}

`mkdir -p some/path` makes one or more nested directories if they don't exist,
and does nothing (without complaining) if they already exist.
It is useful for creating the output directories for build rules.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(automate-ex-print) {-}

The build rule for generating the result for any book should now be:

```makefile
## results/%.csv : regenerate result for any book.
results/%.csv : data/%.txt $(COUNT)
	@bash $(SUMMARY) $< Title
	@bash $(SUMMARY) $< Author
    python $(COUNT) $< > $@
```

where `SUMMARY` is defined earlier in the `Makefile` as

```makefile
SUMMARY=bin/book_summary.sh
```

and the settings build rule now includes:

```makefile
@echo SUMMARY: $(SUMMARY)
```

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(automate-ex-all-results) {-}

Since we already have a variable `RESULTS` that contains all of the results files,
all we need is a phony target that depends on them:

```makefile
.PHONY: results # and all the other phony targets

## results : regenerate result for all books.
results : ${RESULTS}
```

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(automate-ex-wildcard-perils) {-}

If we use a shell \gref{wildcard}{wildcard} in a rule like this:

```makefile
results/collated.csv : results/*.csv
	python $(COLLATE) $^ > $@
```

then if `results/collated.csv` already exists,
the rule tells Make that the file depends on itself.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(automate-ex-readable-docs) {-}

Our rule is:

```makefile
help :
    @grep -h -E '^##' ${MAKEFILE_LIST} | sed -e 's/## //g' \
    | column -t -s ':'
```

-   The `-h` option to `grep` tells it *not* to print filenames,
    while the `-E` option tells it to interpret `^##` as a pattern.

-   `MAKEFILE_LIST` is an automatically defined variable
    with the names of all the Makefiles in play.
    (There might be more than one because Makefiles can include other Makefiles.)

-   `sed` can be used to do string substitution.

-   `column` formats text nicely in columns.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(automate-ex-configuration) {-}

This strategy would be advantageous
if in the future we intended to write a number of different Makefiles
that all use the `countwords.py`, `collate.py` and `plotcounts.py` scripts.

We discuss configuration strategies in more detail in ChapterÂ \@ref(config).

## ChapterÂ \@ref(config) {.unnumbered .unlisted}

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(config-ex-build-plotparams) {-}

The build rule involving `plotcounts.py` should now read:

```makefile
## results/collated.png: plot the collated results.
results/collated.png : results/collated.csv $(PARAMS)
	python $(PLOT) $< --outfile $@ --plotparams $(word 2,$^)
```

where `PARAMS` is defined earlier in the `Makefile`
along with all the other variables and
also included later in the settings build rule:

```makefile
COUNT=bin/countwords.py
COLLATE=bin/collate.py
PARAMS=bin/plotparams.yml
PLOT=bin/plotcounts.py
SUMMARY=bin/book_summary.sh
DATA=$(wildcard data/*.txt)
RESULTS=$(patsubst data/%.txt,results/%.csv,$(DATA))
```

```makefile
## settings : show variables' values.
settings :
	@echo COUNT: $(COUNT)
	@echo DATA: $(DATA)
	@echo RESULTS: $(RESULTS)
	@echo COLLATE: $(COLLATE)
	@echo PARAMS: $(PARAMS)
	@echo PLOT: $(PLOT)
	@echo SUMMARY: $(SUMMARY)
```

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(config-ex-style) {-}

1. Make the following additions to `plotcounts.py`:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

```python
parser.add_argument('--style', type=str,
                    choices=plt.style.available,
                    default=None, help='matplotlib style')
```

```python
def main(args):
    """Run the command line program."""
    if args.style:
        plt.style.use(args.style)
```

3. Add `nargs='*'` to the definition of the `--style` option:

```python
parser.add_argument('--style', type=str, nargs='*',
                    choices=plt.style.available,
                    default=None, help='matplotlib style')
```

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(config-ex-saveload) {-}

The first step is to add a new command-line argument to tell `plotcount.py` what we want to do:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description=__doc__)
    # ...other options as before...
    parser.add_argument('--saveconfig', type=str, default=None,
                        help='Save configuration to file')
    args = parser.parse_args()
    main(args)
```

Next, we add three lines to `main` to act on this option *after* all of the plotting parameters have been set.
For now we use `return` to exit from `main` as soon as the parameters have been saved;
this lets us test our change without overwriting any of our actual plots.

```python
def save_configuration(fname, params):
    """Save configuration to a file."""
    with open(fname, 'w') as reader:
        yaml.dump(params, reader)


def main(args):
    """Run the command line program."""
    if args.style:
        plt.style.use(args.style)
    set_plot_params(args.plotparams)
    if args.saveconfig:
        save_configuration(args.saveconfig, mpl.rcParams)
        return
    df = pd.read_csv(args.infile, header=None,
                     names=('word', 'word_frequency'))
    # ...carry on producing plot...
```

Finally, we add a target to `Makefile` to try out our change.
We do the test this way so that we can be sure that
we're testing with the same options we use with the real program;
if we were to type in the whole command ourselves,
we might use something different.
We also save the configuration to `/tmp` rather than to our project directory
to keep it out of version control's way:

```makefile
## test-saveconfig : save plot configuration.
test-saveconfig :
	python $(PLOT) --saveconfig /tmp/test-saveconfig.yml \
	  --plotparams $(PARAMS)
```

The output is over 400 lines long,
and includes settings for everything from the animation bit rate to the size of y-axis ticks:

```yaml
!!python/object/new:matplotlib.RcParams
dictitems:
  _internal.classic_mode: false
  agg.path.chunksize: 0
  animation.avconv_args: []
  animation.avconv_path: avconv
  animation.bitrate: -1
  ...
  ytick.minor.size: 2.0
  ytick.minor.visible: false
  ytick.minor.width: 0.6
  ytick.right: false
```

The beautiful thing about this file is that the entries are automatically sorted alphabetically,
which makes it easy for both human beings and the `diff` command to spot differences.
This helps reproducibility because any one of these settings might change
in a new release of `matplotlib`,
and any of those changes might affect our plots.
Saving the settings allows us to compare what we had when we did our work
to what we have when we're trying to re-create it,
which in turn gives us a starting point for debugging if we need to.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(config-ex-ini) {-}

```python
import configparser


def set_plot_params(param_file):
    """Set the matplotlib parameters."""
    if param_file:
        config = configparser.ConfigParser()
        config.read(param_file)
        for section in config.sections():
            for param in config[section]:
                value = config[section][param]
                mpl.rcParams[param] = value
```

1.  Most people seem to find Windows INI files easier to write and read,
    since it's easier to see what's a heading and what's a value.

2.  However, Windows INI files only provide one level of sectioning,
    so complex configurations are harder to express.
    Thus, while YAML may be a bit more difficult to get started with,
    it will take us further.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(config-ex-consistency) {-}

The answer depends on whether we are able to make changes to ProgramÂ A and ProgramÂ B.
If we can,
we can modify them to use overlay configuration
and put the shared parameters in a single file that both programs load.
If we can't do that,
the next best thing is to create a small helper program
that reads their configuration files and checks that common parameters have consistent values.
The first solution prevents the problem;
the second detects it,
which is a lot better than nothing.

## ChapterÂ \@ref(testing) {.unnumbered .unlisted}

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(testing-ex-explain-assertions) {-}

-   The first assertion checks that the input sequence `values` is not empty.
    An empty sequence such as `[]` will make it fail.

-   The second assertion checks that each value in the list can be turned into an integer.
    Input such as `[1, 2,'c', 3]` will make it fail.

-   The third assertion checks that the total of the list is greater than 0.
    Input such as `[-10, 2, 3]` will make it fail.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(testing-ex-rectangles) {-}

1. Remove the comments about inserting preconditions and add the following:

```python
assert len(rect) == 4, 'Rectangles must contain 4 coordinates'
x0, y0, x1, y1 = rect
assert x0 < x1, 'Invalid X coordinates'
assert y0 < y1, 'Invalid Y coordinates'
```

2. Remove the comment about inserting postconditions and add the following

```python
assert 0 < upper_x <= 1.0, \
  'Calculated upper X coordinate invalid'
assert 0 < upper_y <= 1.0, \
  'Calculated upper Y coordinate invalid'
```

3. The problem is that the following section of `normalize_rectangle`
should read `float(dy) / dx`, not `float(dx) / dy`.

```python
if dx > dy:
    scaled = float(dx) / dy
```

4. `test_geometry.py` should read as follows:

```python
import geometry


def test_tall_skinny():
    """Test normalization of a tall, skinny rectangle."""
    rect = [20, 15, 30, 20]
    expected_result = (0, 0, 1.0, 0.5)
    actual_result = geometry.normalize_rectangle(rect)
    assert actual_result == expected_result
```

5. Other tests might include (but are not limited to):

```python
def test_short_wide():
    """Test normalization of a short, wide rectangle."""
    rect = [2, 5, 3, 10]
    expected_result = (0, 0, 0.2, 1.0)
    actual_result = geometry.normalize_rectangle(rect)
    assert actual_result == expected_result


def test_negative_coordinates():
    """Test rectangle normalization with negative coords."""
    rect = [-2, 5, -1, 10]
    expected_result = (0, 0, 0.2, 1.0)
    actual_result = geometry.normalize_rectangle(rect)
    assert actual_result == expected_result
```

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(testing-ex-random) {-}

There are three approaches to testing when pseudo-random numbers are involved:

1.  Run the function once with a known \gref{seed}{seed},
    check and record its output,
    and then compare the output of subsequent runs to that saved output.
    (Basically, if the function does the same thing it did the first time, we trust it.)

2.  Replace the \gref{pseudo-random number generator}{prng} with a function of our own
    that generates a predictable series of values.
    For example,
    if we are randomly partitioning a list into two equal halves,
    we could instead use a function that puts odd-numbered values in one partition
    and even-numbered values in another
    (which is a legal but unlikely outcome of truly random partitioning).

3.  Instead of checking for an exact result,
    check that the result lies within certain bounds,
    just as we would with the result of a physical experiment.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(testing-ex-relative-error) {-}

This result seems counter-intuitive to many people because relative error is a measure of a single value,
but in this case we are looking at a distribution of values:
each result is off by 0.1 compared to a range of 0--2,
which doesn't "feel" infinite.
In this case,
a better measure might be the largest \gref{absolute error}{absolute_error}
divided by the standard deviation of the data.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(errors-ex-set-level) {-}

Add a new command-line argument to `collate.py`:

```python
parser.add_argument('-v', '--verbose',
                    action="store_true", default=False,
                    help="Set logging level to DEBUG")
```

and two new lines to the beginning of the `main` function:

```python
log_level = logging.DEBUG if args.verbose else logging.WARNING
logging.basicConfig(level=log_level)
```

such that the full `collate.py` script now reads as follows:

```python

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(errors-ex-logging-output) {-}

Add a new command-line argument to `collate.py`:

```python

                    type=str, default='collate.log',
                    help='Name of the log file')
```

and pass the name of the log file to `logging.basicConfig`
using the `filename` argument:

```python
logging.basicConfig(level=log_lev, filename=args.logfile)
```

such that the `collate.py` script now reads as follows:

```python
"""

    main(args)
```

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(errors-ex-exceptions) {-}

1. The loop in `collate.py` that reads/processes each input file
   should now read as follows:

```python
for fname in args.infiles:
    try:
        logging.debug(f'Reading in {fname}...')
        if fname[-4:] != '.csv':
            msg = ERRORS['not_csv_suffix'].format(fname=fname)
            raise OSError(msg)
        with open(fname, 'r') as reader:
            logging.debug('Computing word counts...')
            update_counts(reader, word_counts)
    except Exception as error:
        logging.warning(f'{fname} not processed: {error}')
```

2. The loop in `collate.py` that reads/processes each input file
   should now read as follows:

```python
for fname in args.infiles:
    try:
        logging.debug(f'Reading in {fname}...')
        if fname[-4:] != '.csv':
            msg = ERRORS['not_csv_suffix'].format(
                fname=fname)
            raise OSError(msg)
        with open(fname, 'r') as reader:
            logging.debug('Computing word counts...')
            update_counts(reader, word_counts)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        msg = f'{fname} not processed: File does not exist'
        logging.warning(msg)
    except PermissionError:
        msg = f'{fname} not processed: No read permission'
        logging.warning(msg)
    except Exception as error:
        msg = f'{fname} not processed: {error}'
        logging.warning(msg)
```

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(errors-ex-error-handling) {-}

1. The `try/except` block in `collate.py` should begin as follows:

   ```python
   try:
       process_file(fname, word_counts)
   except FileNotFoundError:
   # ... the other exceptions
   ```

2. The following additions need to be made to `test_zipfs.py`.

   ```python
   import collate
   ```

   ```python
   def test_not_csv_error():
       """Error handling test for csv check"""
       fname = 'data/dracula.txt'
       word_counts = Counter()
       with pytest.raises(OSError):
           collate.process_file(fname, word_counts)
   ```

3. The following unit test needs to be added to `test_zipfs.py`.

   ```python
   def test_missing_file_error():
       """Error handling test for missing file"""
       fname = 'fake_file.csv'
       word_counts = Counter()
       with pytest.raises(FileNotFoundError):
           collate.process_file(fname, word_counts)
   ```

4. The following sequence of commands is required to test the code coverage.

   ```bash
   $ coverage run -m pytest
   $ coverage html
   ```

   Open `htmlcov/index.html` and click on `bin/collate.py` to view a coverage summary.
   The lines of `process_files` that include the `raise OSError` and
   `open(fname, 'r')` commands should appear in green after clicking the green "run" box
   in the top left-hand corner of the page.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(errors-ex-catalog) {-}

1. The convention is to use `ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES` when defining global variables.

2. Python's f-strings interpolate variables that are in scope:
   there is no easy way to interpolate values from a lookup table.
   In contrast,
   `str.format` can be given any number of named keyword arguments (AppendixÂ \@ref(style)),
   so we can look up a string and then interpolate whatever values we want.

3. Once `ERRORS` has been moved to the `utilities` module,
   all references to it in `collate.py` must be updated to `util.ERRORS`.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(errors-ex-traceback) {-}

A \gref{traceback}{traceback} is an object that records where an exception was
raised), what \gref{stack frames}{stack_frame} were on the
[call stack](#call_stack) when the error occurred, and other details that are
helpful for debugging. Python's [traceback][python-traceback] library can be
used to get and print information from these objects.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(provenance-ex-get-orcid) {-}

You can get an ORCID by registering [here][orcid-registration].
Please add this 16-digit identifier to all of your published works
and to your online profiles.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(provenance-ex-fair-test) {-}

If possible,
compare your answers with those of a colleague who works with the same data.
Where did you agree and disagree, and why?

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(provenance-ex-understand-project) {-}

1.  51 solicitors were interviewed as the participants.

2.  Interview data, and data from a database on court decisions.

3.  This information is not available within the documentation.
    Information on their jobs and opinions are there,
    but the participant demographics are only described within the associated article.
    The difficulty is that the article is not linked within the documentation or the metadata.

4.  We can search the dataset name and author name trying to find this.
    A search for the grant information with "National Science Foundation (1228602)"
    finds the [grant page][meili-grant].
    Two articles are linked there,
    but both the DOI links are broken.
    We can search with the citation for each paper to find them.
    The [Forced Migration article][meili-migration-article]
    uses a different subset of interviews and does not mention demographics,
    nor links to the deposited dataset.
    The [Boston College Law Review article][meili-review-article]
    has the same two problems of different data and no dataset citation.

    Searching more broadly through Meili's work, we can find @Meil2015.
    This lists the dataset as a footnote and reports the 51 interviews
    with demographic data on reported gender of the interviewees.
    This paper lists data collection as 2010--2014,
    while the other two say 2010--2013.
    We might come to a conclusion that this extra year
    is where the extra 9 interviews come in,
    but that difference is not explained anywhere.

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(provenance-ex-eval-code) {-}

For [`borstlab/reversephi_paper`][borstlab-reversephi]:

1.  The software requirements are documented in `README.md`.
    In addition to the tools used in the `zipf/` project (Python, Make and Git),
    the project also requires ImageMagick.
    No information on installing ImageMagick or a required version of ImageMagick is provided.

    To re-create the `conda` environment, you would need the file `my_environment.yml`.
    Instructions for creating and using the environment are provided in `README.md`.

2.  Like `zipf` the data processing and analysis steps are documented in a `Makefile`.
    The `README` includes instructions for re-creating the results using `make all`.

3.  There doesn't seem to be a DOI for the archived code and data,
    but the GitHub repo does have a release `v1.0` with the description "Published manuscript (1.0)" beside it.
    A zip file of this release could be downloaded from GitHub.

For [the figshare page][irving-figshare] that accompanies the paper @Irvi2019:

1. The figshare page includes a "Software environment" section.
   To re-create the `conda` environment, you would need the file `environment.yml`.

2. `figure*_log.txt` are log files for each figure in the paper.
   These files show the computational steps performed in generating the figure,
   in the form of a list of commands executed at the command line.

   `code.zip` is a version controlled (using git) file directory
   containing the code written to perform the analysis
   (i.e., it contains the scripts referred to in the log files).
   This code can also be found on GitHub.

3. The figshare page itself is the archive, and includes a version history for the contents.

For the GitHub repo [`blab/h3n2-reassortment`][blab-h3n2-reassortment]:

1. `README.md` includes an "Install requirements" section
   that describes setting up the `conda` environment using the file `h3n2_reassortment.yaml`.

    The analysis also depends on components from Nextstrain.
    Instructions for cloning them from GitHub are provided.

2. The code seems to be spread across the directories `jupyter_notebooks`, `hyphy`,
   `flu_epidemiology`, and `src`, but it isn't clear what order the code should be run in,
   or how the components depend on each other.

3. The data itself is not archived, but links are provided
   in the "Install requirements" section of `README.md` to
   documents that describe how to obtain the data.
   Some intermediate data is also provided in the `data/` directory.

   The GitHub repo has a release with files "that are up-to-date with the version
   of the manuscript that was submitted to Virus Evolution on 31 January 2019."

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(provenance-ex-publish-code) {-}

Some steps to publishing your project's code would be:

1.  Upload the code on GitHub.
2.  Use a standard folder and file structure as taught in this book.
3.  Include `README`, `CONTRIBUTING`, `CONDUCT`, and `LICENSE` files.
4.  Make sure these files explain how to install and configure the required software
    and tells people how to run the code in the project.
5.  Include a `requirements.txt` file for Python package dependencies.

## ChapterÂ \@ref(packaging) {.unnumbered .unlisted}

### ExerciseÂ \@ref(packaging-ex-metadata) {-}

A `description` and `long_description` argument need to be provided
when the `setup` function is called in `setup.py`.

```

`README.md` should contain a basic description of the package and how to install/use it,
while `setup.py` should contain:

```python
from setuptools import setup


setup(
    name='pratchett',
    version='0.1',
    author='Amira Khan',
    packages=['pratchett'],
)
```

The following sequence of commands will create the development environment,
activate it,

# Key Points {#keypoints}

This appendix lists the key points for each chapter.

## Getting Started


- Make tidiness a habit, rather than cleaning up your project files later.
- Include a few standard files in all your projects, such as README, LICENSE, CONTRIBUTING, CONDUCT and CITATION.
- Put runnable code in a `bin/` directory.
- Put raw/original data in a `data/` directory and never modify it.
- Put results in a `results/` directory. This includes cleaned-up data and figures (i.e., everything created using what's in `bin` and `data`).
- Put documentation and manuscripts in a `docs/` directory.
- Refer to The Carpentries [software installation guide][carpentries-install-instructions] if you're having trouble. 

## The Basics of the Unix Shell


-   A \gref{shell}{shell} is a program that reads commands and runs other programs.
-   The \gref{filesystem}{filesystem} manages information stored on disk.
-   Information is stored in files, which are located in directories (folders).
-   Directories can also store other directories, which forms a directory tree.
-   `pwd` prints the user's \gref{current working directory}{current_working_directory}.
-   `/` on its own is the \gref{root directory}{root_directory} of the whole filesystem.
-   `ls` prints a list of files and directories.
-   An \gref{absolute path}{absolute_path} specifies a location from the root of the filesystem.
-   A \gref{relative path}{relative_path} specifies a location in the filesystem starting from the current directory.
-   `cd` changes the current working directory.
-   `..` means the \gref{parent directory}{parent_directory}.
-   `.` on its own means the current directory.
-   `mkdir` creates a new directory.
-   `cp` copies a file.
-   `rm` removes (deletes) a file.
-   `mv` moves (renames) a file or directory.
-   `*` matches zero or more characters in a filename.
-   `?` matches any single character in a filename.
-   `wc` counts lines, words, and characters in its inputs.
-   `man` displays the manual page for a given command; some commands also have a `--help` option.

## Building Tools with the Unix Shell


-   `cat` displays the contents of its inputs.
-   `head` displays the first few lines of its input.
-   `tail` displays the last few lines of its input.
-   `sort` sorts its inputs.
-   Use the up-arrow key to scroll up through previous commands to edit and repeat them.
-   Use `history` to display recent commands and `!number` to repeat a command by number.
-   Every process in Unix has an input channel called \gref{standard input}{stdin}
    and an output channel called \gref{standard output}{stdin}.
-   `>` redirects a command's output to a file, overwriting any existing content.
-   `>>` appends a command's output to a file.
-   `<` operator redirects input to a command.
-   A \gref{pipe}{pipe_shell} `|` sends the output of the command on the left to the input of the command on the right.
-   A `for` loop repeats commands once for every thing in a list.
-   Every `for` loop  must have a variable to refer to the thing it is currently operating on
    and a \gref{body}{loop_body} containing commands to execute.
-   Use `$name` or `${name}` to get the value of a variable.

## Going Further with the Unix Shell


-   Save commands in files (usually called \gref{shell scripts}{shell_script}) for re-use.
-   `bash filename` runs the commands saved in a file.
-   `$@` refers to all of a shell script's command-line arguments.
-   `$1`, `$2`, etc., refer to the first command-line argument, the second command-line argument, etc.
-   Place variables in quotes if the values might have spaces or other special characters in them.
-   `find` prints a list of files with specific properties or whose names match patterns.
-   `$(command)` inserts a command's output in place.
-   `grep` selects lines in files that match patterns.
-   Use the `.bashrc` file in your home directory to set shell variables each time the shell runs.
-   Use `alias` to create shortcuts for things you type frequently.

## Building Command-Line Programs in Python


-   Write command-line Python programs that can be run in the \gref{Unix shell}{shell} like other command-line tools.
-   If the user does not specify any input files, read from \gref{standard input}{stdin}.
-   If the user does not specify any output files, write to \gref{standard output}{stdout}.
-   Place all `import` statements at the start of a module.
-   Use the value of `__name__` to determine if a file is being run directly or being loaded as a module.
-   Use [`argparse`][argparse] to handle command-line arguments in standard ways.
-   Use \gref{short options}{short_option} for common controls and \gref{long options}{long_option} for less common or more complicated ones.
-   Use \gref{docstrings}{docstring} to document functions and scripts.
-   Place functions that are used across multiple scripts in a separate file that those scripts can import.

## Using Git at the Command Line


-   Use `git config` with the `--global` option to configure your username,
    email address, and other preferences once per machine.
-   `git init` initializes a \gref{repository}{repository}.
-   Git stores all repository management data in the `.git` subdirectory of the repository's root directory.
-   `git status` shows the status of a repository.
-   `git add` puts files in the repository's staging area.
-   `git commit` saves the staged content as a new commit in the local repository.
-   `git log` lists previous commits.
-   `git diff` shows the difference between two versions of the repository.
-   Synchronize your local repository with a \gref{remote repository}{remote_repository}
    on a \gref{forge}{forge} such as [GitHub][github].
-   `git remote` manages bookmarks pointing at remote repositories.
-   `git push` copies changes from a local repository to a remote repository.
-   `git pull` copies changes from a remote repository to a local repository.
-   `git restore` and `git checkout` recover old versions of files.
-   The `.gitignore` file tells Git what files to ignore.

## Going Further with Git


-   Use a \gref{branch-per-feature}{branch_per_feature} workflow to develop new features while leaving the master branch in working order.
-   `git branch` creates a new branch. 
-   `git checkout` switches between branches.
-   `git merge` \gref{merges}{git_merge} changes from another branch into the current branch.
-   \gref{Conflicts}{git_conflict} occur when files or parts of files are changed in different ways on different branches.
-   Version control systems do not allow people to overwrite changes silently;
    instead, they highlight conflicts that need to be resolved.
-   \gref{Forking}{git_fork} a repository makes a copy of it on a server.
-   \gref{Cloning}{git_clone} a repository with `git clone` creates a local copy of a remote repository.
-   Create a remote called `upstream` to point to the repository a fork was derived from.
-   Create \gref{pull requests}{pull_request} to submit changes from your fork to the upstream repository.

## Working in Teams


-   Welcome and nurture community members proactively.
-   Create an explicit Code of Conduct for your project modeled on the [Contributor Covenant][covenant].
-   Include a license in your project so that it's clear who can do what with the material.
-   Create \gref{issues}{issue} for bugs, enhancement requests, and discussions.
-   \gref{Label issues}{issue_label} to identify their purpose.
-   \gref{Triage}{triage} issues regularly and group them into \gref{milestones}{milestone} to track progress.
-   Include contribution guidelines in your project that specify its workflow and its expectations of participants.
-   Make rules about \gref{governance}{governance} explicit.
-   Use common-sense rules to make project meetings fair and productive.
-   Manage conflict between participants rather than hoping it will take care of itself.

## Automating Analyses with Make


-   [Make][gnu-make] is a widely used build manager.
-   A \gref{build manager}{build_manager} re-runs commands to update files that are out of date.
-   A \gref{build rule}{build_rule} has \gref{targets}{build_target}, \gref{prerequisites}{prerequisite}, and a \gref{recipe}{build_recipe}.
-   A target can be a file or a \gref{phony target}{phony_target} that simply triggers an action.
-   When a target is out of date with respect to its prerequisites, Make executes the recipe associated with its rule.
-   Make executes as many rules as it needs to when updating files, but always respects prerequisite order.
-   Make defines \gref{automatic variables}{automatic_variable} such as `$@` (target), `$^` (all prerequisites), and `$<` (first prerequisite).
-   \gref{Pattern rules}{pattern_rule} can use `%` as a placeholder for parts of filenames.
-   Makefiles can define variables using `NAME=value`.
-   Make also has functions such as `$(wildcard...)` and `$(patsubst...)`.
-   Use specially formatted comments to create self-documenting Makefiles.

## Configuring Programs

-   Use a user-specific configuration file for personal preferences.
-   Use a job-specific configuration file with settings for a particular run.
-   Use command-line options to change things that commonly change.
-   Use \gref{YAML}{yaml_glossary} or some other standard syntax to write configuration files.
-   Save configuration information to make your research \gref{reproducible}{reproducible_research}.

## Testing Software

    and to make tolerances on "enough" explicit.
-   Add \gref{assertions}{assertion} to code so that it checks itself as it runs.
-   Write \gref{unit tests}{unit_test} to check individual pieces of code.
-   Write \gref{integration tests}{integration_test} to check that those pieces work together correctly.
-   Write \gref{regression tests}{regression_testing} to check if things that used to work no longer do.
-   A \gref{test framework}{test_framework} finds and runs tests written in a prescribed fashion and reports their results.
-   Test \gref{coverage}{code_coverage} is the fraction of lines of code that are executed by a set of tests.
-   \gref{Continuous integration}{continuous_integration} re-builds and/or re-tests software every time something changes.

## Handling Errors


-   Signal errors by \gref{raising exceptions}{raise_exception}.
-   Use `try`/`except` blocks to \gref{catch}{catch_exception} and handle exceptions.
-   Python organizes its standard exceptions in a hierarchy so that programs can catch and handle them selectively.
-   "Throw low, catch high," i.e., raise exceptions immediately but handle them at a higher level.
-   Write error messages that help users figure out what to do to fix the problem.
-   Store error messages in a lookup table to ensure consistency.
-   Use a \gref{logging framework}{logging_framework} instead of `print` statements to report program activity.
-   Separate logging messages into `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, and `CRITICAL` levels.
-   Use `logging.basicConfig` to define basic logging parameters.

## Tracking Provenance


-   Publish data and code as well as papers.
-   Use \gref{DOIs}{doi} to identify reports, datasets, and software releases.
-   Use an \gref{ORCID}{orcid} to identify yourself as an author of a report, dataset, or software release.
-   Data should be [FAIR][go-fair]: findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable.
-   Put small datasets in version control repositories; store large ones on data sharing sites.
-   Describe your software environment, analysis scripts, and data processing steps in \gref{reproducible}{reproducible_research} ways.

# Working Remotely {#ssh}

When the Internet was young,
people didn't encrypt anything except the most sensitive information when sending it over a network.
However,
this meant that villains could steal usernames and passwords.
The \gref{SSH protocol}{ssh_protocol}
was invented to prevent this (or at least slow it down).
It uses several sophisticated (and heavily tested) encryption protocols
to ensure that outsiders can't see what's in the messages
going back and forth between different computers.

To understand how it works,
let's take a closer look at what happens when we use the shell
on a desktop or laptop computer.
The first step is to log in
so that the operating system knows who we are and what we're allowed to do.
We do this by typing our username and password;
the operating system checks those values against its records,
and if they match,
runs a shell for us.

As we type commands,
characters are sent from our keyboard to the shell.
It displays those characters on the screen to represent what we type,
and then executes the command and displays its output (if any).
If we want to run commands on another machine,
such as the server in the basement that manages our database of experimental results,
we have to log in to that machine so that our commands will go to it instead of to our laptop.
We call this a \gref{remote login}{remote_login}.

## Logging In {#ssh-login}

In order for us to be able to log in,
the remote computer must run a \gref{remote login server}{remote_login_server}
and we must run a program that can talk to that server.
The client program passes our login credentials to the remote login server;
if we are allowed to log in,
that server then runs a shell for us on the remote computer (FigureÂ \@ref(fig:ssh-ssh)).

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/ssh/ssh.svg" alt="The local client connects to the remote login server, which starts a remote shell (solid lines). Commands from the local client are passed to the remote shell and output is passed back (dashed lines)." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:ssh-ssh)The local client connects to the remote login server, which starts a remote shell (solid lines). Commands from the local client are passed to the remote shell and output is passed back (dashed lines).</p>
</div>

Once our local client is connected to the remote server,
everything we type into the client is passed on, by the server, to the shell
running on the remote computer.
That remote shell runs those commands on our behalf,
just as a local shell would,
then sends back output, via the server, to our client, for our computer to display.

The remote login server which accepts connections from client programs
is known as the \gref{SSH daemon}{ssh_daemon}, or `sshd`.
The client program we use to log in remotely is the \gref{secure shell}{ssh_glossary},
or `ssh`.
It has a companion program called `scp`
that allows us to copy files to or from a remote computer using the same kind of encrypted connection.

We issue the command `ssh username@computer` to log in remotely.
This command tries to make a connection to the SSH daemon running on the remote computer we have specified.
After we log in,
we can use the remote shell to use the remote computer's files and directories.
Typing `exit` or Control-D
terminates the remote shell, and the local client program, and returns us to our previous shell.

In the example below,
the remote machine's command prompt is `moon>`
instead of `$` to make it clearer which machine is doing what.

```bash
$ pwd
```

```text
/Users/amira
```

```bash
$ ssh amira@moon.euphoric.edu
Password: ********
```

```bash
moon> hostname
```

```text
moon
```

```bash
moon> pwd
```

```text
/Users/amira
```

```bash
moon> ls -F
```

```text
bin/     cheese.txt   dark_side/   rocks.cfg
```

```bash
moon> exit
```

```bash
$ pwd
```

```text
/Users/amira
```

## Copying Files {#ssh-cp}

To copy a file,
we specify the source and destination paths,
either of which may include computer names.
If we leave out a computer name,
`scp` assumes we mean the machine we're running on.
For example,
this command copies our latest results to the backup server in the basement,
printing out its progress as it does so:

\newpage

```bash
$ scp results.dat amira@backup:backups/results-2019-11-11.dat
Password: ********
```

```text
results.dat              100%  9  1.0 MB/s 00:00
```

Note the colon `:`, separating the hostname of the server and the pathname of
the file we are copying to.
It is this character that informs `scp` that the source or target of the copy is
on the remote machine and the reason it is needed can be explained as follows:

In the same way that the default directory into which we are placed when running
a shell on a remote machine is our home directory on that machine, the default
target, for a remote copy, is also the  home directory.

This means that:

```bash
$ scp results.dat amira@backup:
```

would copy `results.dat` into our home directory on `backup`, however, if we did not
have the colon to inform `scp` of the remote machine, we would still have a valid command:

```bash
$ scp results.dat amira@backup
```

but now we have merely created a file called `amira@backup` on our local machine,
as we would have done with `cp`.

```bash
$ cp results.dat amira@backup
```

Copying a whole directory between remote machines uses the same syntax as the `cp` command:
we just use the `-r` option to signal that we want copying to be recursive.
For example,
this command copies all of our results from the backup server to our laptop:

```bash
$ scp -r amira@backup:backups ./backups
Password: ********
```

```text
results-2019-09-18.dat              100%  7  1.0 MB/s 00:00
results-2019-10-04.dat              100%  9  1.0 MB/s 00:00
results-2019-10-28.dat              100%  8  1.0 MB/s 00:00
results-2019-11-11.dat              100%  9  1.0 MB/s 00:00
```

## Running Commands {#ssh-cmd}

Here's one more thing the `ssh` client program can do for us.
Suppose we want to check whether we have already created the file
`backups/results-2019-11-12.dat` on the backup server.
Instead of logging in and then typing `ls`,
we could do this:

```bash
$ ssh amira@backup "ls results*"
Password: ********
```

```text
results-2019-09-18.dat  results-2019-10-28.dat
results-2019-10-04.dat  results-2019-11-11.dat
```

Here, `ssh` takes the argument after our remote username
and passes it to the shell on the remote computer.
(`ls results` has multiple words, so we have to put quotes around it to make it look like one value.)
Since those arguments are a legal command,
the remote shell runs `ls results` for us
and sends the output back to our local shell for display.

## Creating Keys {#ssh-keys}

Typing our password over and over again is annoying,
especially if the commands we want to run remotely are in a loop.
To remove the need to do this,
we can create an \gref{SSH key}{ssh_key}
to tell the remote machine
that it should always trust us.

SSH keys come in pairs, a public key that gets shared with services like GitHub,
and a private key that is stored only on our computer. If the keys match,
we are granted access.
The cryptography behind SSH keys ensures that no one can reverse-engineer our
private key from the public one.

We might already have an SSH key pair on our machine.
We can check by moving to our `.ssh` directory and listing the contents.

```bash
$ cd ~/.ssh
$ ls
```

If we see `id_rsa.pub`,
we already have a key pair and don't need to create a new one.

If we don't see `id_rsa.pub`,
this command will generate a new key pair.
(Make sure to replace `your@email.com` with your own email address.)

```bash
$ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your@email.com"
```

When asked where to save the new key,
press enter to accept the default location.

```text
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key
(/Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa):
```

We will then be asked to provide an optional passphrase.
This can be used to make your key even more secure,
but if we want to avoid typing our password every time,
we can skip it by pressing enter twice:

```text
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
```

When key generation is complete,
we should see the following confirmation:

```text
Your identification has been saved in
/Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in 
/Users/username/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
01:0f:f4:3b:ca:85:d6:17:a1:7d:f0:68:9d:f0:a2:db your@email.com
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+
|                 |
|                 |
|        . E +    |
|       . o = .   |
|      . S =   o  |
|       o.O . o   |
|       o .+ .    |
|      . o+..     |
|       .+=o      |
+-----------------+
```

(The random art image is an alternate way to match keys.)
We now need to place a copy of our public key on
any servers we would like to connect to.
Display the contents of our public key file with `cat`:

```bash
$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

```text
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAABIwAAAQEA879BJGYlPTLIuc9/R5MYiN4yc/
YiCLcdBpSdzgK9Dt0Bkfe3rSz5cPm4wmehdE7GkVFXrBJ2YHqPLuM1yx1AUxIe
bpwlIl9f/aUHOts9eVnVh4NztPy0iSU/Sv0b2ODQQvcy2vYcujlorscl8JjAgf

GZiK/74eHbSLKA4PY3gM4GHI450Nie16yggEg2aTQfWA1rry9JYWEoHS9pJ1dn
LqZU3k/8OWgqJrilwSoC5rGjgp93iu0H8T6+mEHGRQe84Nk1y5lESSWIbn6P63
6Bl3uQ== your@email.com
```

Copy the contents of the output,
then log in to the remote server as usual:

```bash
$ ssh amira@moon.euphoric.edu
Password: ********
```

Paste the copied content at the end of `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`.

```bash
moon> nano ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

After appending the content,
log out of the remote machine and try to log in again.
If we set up the SSH key correctly, we won't need to type our password:

```bash
moon> exit
```

```bash
$ ssh amira@moon.euphoric.edu
```

## Dependencies {#ssh-filedir}

The example of copying our public key to a remote machine, so that it
can then be used when we next SSH into that remote machine, assumed
that we already had a directory `~/.ssh/`.

While a remote server may support the use of SSH to log in, your home
directory there may not contain a `.ssh` directory by default.

We have already seen that we can use SSH to run commands on remote
machines, so we can ensure that everything is set up as required before
we place the copy of our public key on a remote machine.

Walking through this process allows us to highlight some of the typical
requirements of the SSH protocol itself, as documented in the man page
for the `ssh` command.

Firstly, we check that we have a `.ssh/` directory on another remote
machine, `comet`

```bash
$ ssh amira@comet "ls -ld ~/.ssh"
Password: ********
```

```text
ls: cannot access /Users/amira/.ssh: No such file or directory
```

Oops:
we should create the directory and check that it's there:

```bash
$ ssh amira@comet "mkdir ~/.ssh"
Password: ********
```

```bash
$ ssh amira@comet "ls -ld ~/.ssh"
Password: ********
```

```text
drwxr-xr-x 2 amira amira 512 Jan 01 09:09 /Users/amira/.ssh
```

Now we have a `.ssh` directory, into which to place SSH-related
files, but we can see that the default permissions allow anyone to
inspect the files within that directory.
This is not considered a good thing for a protocol that is supposed to be secure,
so the recommended permissions are read/write/execute
for the user, and not accessible by others.

Let's alter the permissions on the directory:

```bash
$ ssh amira@comet "chmod 700 ~/.ssh; ls -ld ~/.ssh"
Password: ********
```

```text
drwx------ 2 amira amira 512 Jan 01 09:09 /Users/amira/.ssh
```

That looks much better.

In the above example, it was suggested that we paste the content of
our public key at the end of `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`, however as
we didn't have a `~/.ssh/` on this remote machine, we can simply
copy our public key over as the initial `~/.ssh/authorized_keys`,
and of course, we will use `scp` to do this, even though we don't
yet have passwordless SSH access set up.

```bash
$ scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub amira@comet:.ssh/authorized_keys
Password: ********
```

Note that the default target for the `scp` command on a remote
machine is the home directory, so we have not needed to use the
shorthand `~/.ssh/` or even the full path `/Users/amira/.ssh/` to
our home directory there.

Checking the permissions of the file we have just created on
the remote machine, also serves to indicate that we no longer
need to use our password, because we now have what's needed
to use SSH without it.

```bash
$ ssh amira@comet "ls -l ~/.ssh"
```

```text
-rw-r--r-- 2 amira amira 512 Jan 01 09:11
/Users/amira/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

While the authorized keys file is not considered to be highly sensitive
(after all, it contains public keys), we alter the permissions to match
the man page's recommendations.

```bash
$ ssh amira@comet "chmod go-r ~/.ssh/authorized_keys; ls -l
~/.ssh"
```

```text
-rw------- 2 amira amira 512 Jan 01 09:11
/Users/amira/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

# Writing Readable Code {#style}

Nothing in biology makes sense except in light of evolution [@Dobz1973].
Similarly,
nothing in software development makes sense except in light of human psychology.
This is particularly true when we look at programming style.
Computers don't need to understand programs in order to execute them,
but people do if they are to create, debug, and extend them.

Throughout this book we have written code to analyze word counts in classic novels
using good Python style.
This appendix discusses the style choices we made,
presents guidelines for good Python programming style,\index{Python!style}
and introduces some language features that can make programs more flexible and more readable.

## Python Style {#style-pep8}

The single most important rule of style is to be consistent,
both internally and with other programs [@Kern1999].
Python's standard style is called [PEP-8][pep-8];\index{Python!PEP-8}\index{PEP-8 (Python style)}
the acronym "PEP" is short for "Python Enhancement Proposal,"
and PEP-8 lays out the rules that Python's own libraries use.
Some of its rules are listed below,
along with others borrowed from "[Code Smells and Feels][code-smells-and-feels]."

### Spacing

**Always indent code blocks using 4 spaces, and use spaces instead of tabs.**

Python doesn't actually require consistent indentation
so long as each block is indented the same amount,
which means that this is legal:\index{whitespace}

```python
def transpose(original):
  result = Matrix(original.numRow, original.numCol)
  for row in range(original.numRow):
              for col in range(original.numCol):
               result[row, col] = original[col, row]
  return result
```

The same block of code is much more readable when written as:

```python
def transpose(original):
    result = Matrix(original.numRow, original.numCol)
    for row in range(original.numRow):
        for col in range(original.numCol):
            result[row, col] = original[col, row]
    return result
```

The use of 4 spaces is a compromise between 2
(which we find perfectly readable, but some people find too crowded)
and 8
(which most people agree uses up too much horizontal space).
As for the use of spaces rather than tabs,
the original reason was that the most common interpretation of tabs
by the editors of the 1980s was 8 spaces,
which again was more than most people felt necessary.
Today,
almost all editors will auto-indent or auto-complete when the tab key is pressed
(or insert spaces, if configured to do so),
but the legacy of those ancient times lives on.

**Do not put spaces inside parentheses.**

Write `(1+2)` instead of `(Â 1+2Â )`.
This applies to function calls as well:
write `max(a, b)` rather than `max(Â a,Â bÂ )`.
(We will see a related rule when we discuss default parameter values
in SectionÂ \@ref(style-features).)

**Always use spaces around comparisons like `>` and `<=`.**

Python automatically interprets `a+b<c+d` as `(a+b)<(c+d)`,
but that's a lot of punctuation crowded together.
Using spaces around comparison operators makes it easier to see
what's being compared to what.
However,
we should use our own judgment for spacing around arithmetic operators like `+` and `/`.
For example,
`a+b+c` is perfectly readable,
but

```python
substrate[i, j] + overlay[i, j]
```

is easier for the eye to follow than the spaceless:

```python
substrate[i, j]+overlay[i, j]
```

Most programmers would also write:

```python
a*b + c*d
```

instead of:

```python
a*b+c*d
```

or:

```python
(a*b)+(c*d)
```

Adding spaces makes simple expressions more readable,
but does not change the way Python interprets them---when it encounters `aÂ *Â b+c`,
for example,
Python still does the multiplication before the addition.

**Put two blank lines between each function definition.**

This helps the eye see where one ends and the next begins,
though the fact that functions always start in the first column helps as well.

**Add an empty line at the end of the script.**

Ending a file in a newline character is required for some other programming languages.
Although it's not required for Python code to function,
it does make it easier to view and edit code.\index{whitespace}

### Naming

**Use `ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES` for global variables.**

This convention is inherited from C,\index{Python!style!variable naming}
which was used to write the first version of Python.
In that language,
upper case was used to indicate a constant whose value couldn't be modified;
Python doesn't enforce that rule,
but `SHOUTING_AT_PROGRAMMERS` helps remind them that
some things shouldn't be messed with.

**Use `lower_case_with_underscores` for the names of functions and variables.**

Research on naming conventions has produced mixed results [@Bink2012; @Scha2018]
but Python has (mostly) settled on underscored names for most things.
This style is called \gref{snake case}{snake_case} or \gref{pothole case}{pothole_case};
we should only use \gref{CamelCase}{camel_case} for classes,
which are outside the scope of this lesson.

**Avoid abbreviations in function and variable names.**

Abbreviations and acronyms can be ambiguous
(does `xcl` mean "Excel", "exclude", or "excellent"?),
and can be hard for non-native speakers to understand.
Following this rule doesn't necessarily require more typing:
a good programming editor will \gref{auto-complete}{auto_completion} names for us.

**Use short names for short-lived local variables and longer names for things with wider scope.**

Using `i` and `j` for loop indices is perfectly readable
provided the loop is only a few lines long [@Beni2017].
Anything that is used at a greater distance
or whose purpose isn't immediately clear
(such as a function) should have a longer name.

**Do not comment and uncomment sections of code to change behavior.**

If we need to do something in some runs of the program and not in others,
use an `if` statement to enable or disable that block of code:
it eliminates the risk of accidentally commenting out one too many lines.
If the lines we were removing or commenting out print debugging information,
we should replace them with logging calls (SectionÂ \@ref(errors-logging)).
If they are operations that we want to execute,
we can add a configuration option (ChapterÂ \@ref(config)),
and if we are sure we don't need the code,
we should take it out completely:
we can always get it back from version control
(SectionÂ \@ref(git-cmdline-ex-recover)).

## Order {#style-order}

The order of items in each file should be:\index{Python!style!order in file}

-   The \gref{shebang}{shebang} line (because it has to be first to work).\index{shebang (in shell script)}
-   The file's documentation string (SectionÂ \@ref(scripting-docstrings)).
-   All of the `import` statements, one per line.
-   Global variable definitions
    (especially things that would be constants in languages that support them).
-   Function definitions.
-   If the file can be run as a program,
    the `if __name__ == '__main__'` statement discussed in
    SectionÂ \@ref(scripting-main).

That much is clear,
but programmers disagree (strongly) on whether high-level functions should come first or last,
i.e.,
whether `main` should be the first function in the file or the last one.
Our scripts put it last,
so that it is immediately before the check on `__name__`.
Wherever it goes,
`main` tends to follow one of three patterns:

1.  Figure out what the user has asked it to do (ChapterÂ \@ref(config)).
2.  Read all input data.
3.  Process it.
4.  Write output.

or:

1.  Figure out what the user has asked for.
2.  For each input file:
    1.  Read.
    2.  Process.
    3.  Write file-specific output (if any).
3.  Write summary output (if any).

or:

1.  Figure out what the user has asked for.
2.  Repeatedly:
    1.  Wait for user input.
    2.  Do what the user has asked.
3.  Exit when a "stop" command of some sort is received.

Each step in each of the outlines above usually becomes a function.
Those functions depend on others,
some of which are written to break code into comprehensible chunks and are then called just once,
others of which are utilities that may be called many times from many different places.

We put all of the single-use functions in the first half of the file
in the order in which they are likely to be called,
and then put all of the multi-use utility functions in the bottom of the file in alphabetical order.
If any of those utility functions are used by other scripts or programs,
they should go in a file of their own (SectionÂ \@ref(scripting-modules)).

In fact,
this is a good practice even if those functions are only used by one program,
since it signals even more clearly which are specific to this program
and which are likely to be reused elsewhere.
This is why we create `collate.py` in SectionÂ \@ref(scripting-collate):
we could have kept all of our code in `countwords.py`,
but collating felt like something we might want to do separately.

## Checking Style {#style-check}

Checking that code conforms to guidelines like PEP-8 would be time consuming
if we had to do it manually,
but most languages have tools that will check style rules for us.
These tools are often called \gref{linters}{linter},\index{lint (style checking tool)}\index{Python!style!checking}
after an early tool called [`lint`][lint] that found lint (or fluff) in C code.

Python's linter used to be called `pep8` and is now called `pycodestyle`.
To see how it works,
let's look at this program,
which is supposed to count the number of \gref{stop words}{stop_word} in a document:

```python
stops = ['a', 'A', 'the', 'The', 'and']

def count(ln):
    n = 0
    for i in range(len(ln)):
        line = ln[i]
        stuff = line.split()
        for word in stuff:
            # print(word)
            j = stops.count(word)
            if (j > 0) == True:
                n = n + 1
    return n

import sys

lines = sys.stdin.readlines()
# print('number of lines', len(lines))
n = count(lines)
print('number', n)
```

When we run:

```bash
$ pycodestyle count_stops.py
```

it prints:

```text
src/style/count_stops_before.py:3:1:
E302 expected 2 blank lines, found 1
src/style/count_stops_before.py:11:24:
E712 comparison to True should be
'if cond is True:' or 'if cond:'
src/style/count_stops_before.py:12:13:
E101 indentation contains mixed spaces and tabs
src/style/count_stops_before.py:12:13:
W191 indentation contains tabs
src/style/count_stops_before.py:15:1:
E305 expected 2 blank lines after class or function definition,
  found 1
src/style/count_stops_before.py:15:1:
E402 module level import not at top of file
```

which tells us that:

-   We should use two blank lines before the function definition on line 3
    and after it on line 15.
-   Using `== True` or `== False` is redundant
    (because `x == True` is the same as `x`
    and `x == False` is the same as `not x`).
-   Line 12 uses tabs instead of just spaces.
-   The `import` on line 15 should be at the top of the file.

Fixing these issues gives us:

```python
import sys


stops = ['a', 'A', 'the', 'The', 'and']


def count(ln):
    n = 0
    for i in range(len(ln)):
        line = ln[i]
        stuff = line.split()
        for word in stuff:
            # print(word)
            j = stops.count(word)
            if j > 0:
                n = n + 1
    return n


lines = sys.stdin.readlines()
# print('number of lines', len(lines))
n = count(lines)
print('number', n)
```

## Refactoring {#style-refactor}

Once a program gets a clean bill of health from `pycodestyle`,
it's worth having a human being look it over and suggest improvements.
To \gref{refactor}{refactoring} code\index{refactoring (software)}
means to change its structure without changing what it does,
like simplifying an equation.
It is just as much a part of programming as writing code in the first place:
nobody gets things right the first time [@Bran1995],
and needs or insights can change over time.

Most discussions of refactoring focus on \gref{object-oriented programming}{oop},
but many patterns can and should be used to clean up \gref{procedural}{procedural_programming} code.
Knowing a few of these patterns helps us create better software
and makes it easier to communicate with our peers.

### Do not repeat values

The first and simplest refactoring is "replace value with name."
It tells us to replace magic numbers with names,
i.e., to define constants.
This can seem ridiculous in simple cases
(why define and use `inches_per_foot` instead of just writing 12?).
However,
what may be obvious to us when we're writing code won't be obvious to the next person,
particularly if they are working in a different context
(most of the world uses the metric system and doesn't know how many inches are in a foot).
It is also a matter of habit:
if we write numbers without explanation in our code for simple cases,
we are more likely to do so in complex cases,
and more likely to regret it afterward.

\newpage

Using names instead of raw values also makes it easier to understand code when we read it aloud,
which is always a good test of its style.
Finally,
a single value defined in one place is much easier to change
than a bunch of numbers scattered throughout our program.
We may not think we will have to change it,
but then people want to use our software on Mars and we discover that constants aren't [@Mak2006].

```python
# ...before...
seconds_elapsed = num_days * 24 * 60 * 60
```

```python
# ...after...
SECONDS_PER_DAY = 24 * 60 * 60
# ...other code...
seconds_elapsed = num_days * SECONDS_PER_DAY
```

### Do not repeat calculations in loops

It's inefficient to calculate the same value over and over again.
It also makes code less readable:
if a calculation is inside a loop or a function,
readers will assume that it might change each time the code is executed.

Our second refactoring,
"hoist repeated calculation out of loop,"
tells us to move the repeated calculation out of the loop or function.
Doing this signals that its value is always the same.
And naming that common value helps readers understand what its purpose is.

```python
# ...before...
for sample in signals:
    output.append(2 * pi * sample / weight)
```

```python
# ...after...
scaling = 2 * pi / weight
for sample in signals:
    output.append(sample * scaling)
```

### Replace tests with flags to clarify repeated tests

Novice programmers frequently write conditional tests like this:

```python
if (a > b) == True:
    # ...do something...
```

The comparison to `True` is unnecessary because `a > b` is a Boolean value
that is itself either `True` or `False`.
Like any other value,
Booleans can be assigned to variables,
and those variables can then be used directly in tests:

```python
was_greater = estimate > 0.0
# ...other code that might change estimate...
if was_greater:
    # ...do something...
```

This refactoring is "replace repeated test with flag."
Again,
there is no need to write `if was_greater == True`:
that always produces the same result as `if was_greater`.
Similarly,
the equality tests in `if was_greater == False` is redundant:
the expression can simply be written `if not was_greater`.
Creating and using a \gref{flag}{flag_variable} instead of repeating the test
is therefore like moving a calculation out of a loop:
even if that value is only used once,
it makes our intention clearer.

```python
# ...before...
def process_data(data, scaling):
    if len(data) > THRESHOLD:
        scaling = sqrt(scaling)
    # ...process data to create score...
    if len(data) > THRESHOLD:
        score = score ** 2
```

```python
# ...after...
def process_data(data, scaling):
    is_large_data = len(data) > THRESHOLD
    if is_large_data:
        scaling = sqrt(scaling)
    # ...process data to create score...
    if is_large_data:
        score = score ** 2
```

If it takes many lines of code to process data and create a score,
and the test then needs to change from `>` to `>=`,
we are more likely to get the refactored version right the first time,
since the test only appears in one place and its result is given a name.

### Use in-place operators to avoid duplicating expression

An \gref{in-place operator}{in_place_operator},
sometimes called an \gref{update operator}{update_operator},
does a calculation with two values
and overwrites one of the values.
For example,
instead of writing:

```python
step = step + 1
```

we can write:

```python
step += 1
```

In-place operators save us some typing.
They also make the intention clearer,
and most importantly,
they make it harder to get complex assignments wrong.
For example:

```python
samples[least_factor,
        max(current_offset, offset_limit)] *= scaling_factor
```

is less difficult to read than the equivalent expression:

```python
samples[least_factor, max(current_offset, offset_limit)] = \
    scaling_factor * samples[least_factor,
                             max(current_limit,
                                 offset_limit)]
```

(The proof of this claim is that you probably didn't notice
that the long form uses different expressions to index `samples`
on the left and right of the assignment.)
The refactoring "use in-place operator" does what its name suggests:
converts normal assignments into their briefer equivalents.

```python
# ...before...
for least_factor in all_factors:
    samples[least_factor] = \
        samples[least_factor] * bayesian_scaling
```

```python
# ...after...
for least_factor in all_factors:
    samples[least_factor] *= bayesian_scaling
```

### Handle special cases first

A \gref{short circuit test}{short_circuit_test} is a quick check to handle a special case,
such as checking the length of a list of values
and returning `math.nan` for the average if the list is empty.
"Place short circuits early" tells us to put short-circuit tests near the start of functions
so that readers can mentally remove special cases from their thinking
while reading the code that handles the usual case.

```python
# ...before...
def rescale_by_average(values, factors, weights):
    a = 0.0
    for (f, w) in zip(factors, weights):
        a += f * w
    if a == 0.0:
        return
    a /= len(f)
    if not values:
        return
    else:
        for (i, v) in enumerate(values):
            values[i] = v / a
```

```python
# ...after...
def rescale_by_average(values, factors, weights):
    if (not values) or (not factors) or (not weights):
        return
    a = 0.0
    for (f, w) in zip(factors, weights):
        a += f * w
    a /= len(f)
    for (i, v) in enumerate(values):
        values[i] = v / a
```


> **Return Consistently**
>
> PEP-8 says, "Be consistent in `return` statements,"
> and goes on to say that either all `return` statements in a function should return a value,
> or none of them should.
> If a function contains any explicit `return` statements at all,
> it should end with one as well.

A related refactoring pattern is "default and override."
To use it,
assign a default or most common value to a variable unconditionally,
and then override it in a special case.
The result is fewer lines of code and clearer control flow;
however,
it does mean executing two assignments instead of one,
so it shouldn't be used if the common case is expensive
(e.g., involves a database lookup or a web request).

```python
# ...before..
if configuration['threshold'] > UPPER_BOUND:
    scale = 0.8
else:
    scale = 1.0
```

```python
# ...after...
scale = 1.0
if configuration['threshold'] > UPPER_BOUND:
    scale = 0.8
```

In simple cases,
people will sometimes put the test and assignment on a single line:

```python
scale = 1.0
if configuration['threshold'] > UPPER_BOUND: scale = 0.8
```

\newpage

Some programmers take this even further
and use a \gref{conditional expression}{conditional_expression}:

```python
scale = 0.8 if configuration['threshold'] > UPPER_BOUND else 1.0
```

However,
this puts the default last instead of first,
which is less clear.

> **A Little Jargon**
>
> `X if test else Y` is called a \gref{ternary expression}{ternary_expression}.
> Just as a binary expression like `A + B` has two parts,
> a ternary expression has three.
> Conditional expressions are the only ternary expressions in most programming languages.

### Use functions to make code more comprehensible

Functions were created so that programmers could re-use common operations,
but moving code into functions also reduces \gref{cognitive load}{cognitive_load}
by reducing the number of things that have to be understood simultaneously.

A common rule of thumb is that
no function should be longer than a printed page (about 80 lines)
or have more than four levels of indentation because of nested loops and conditionals.
Anything longer or more deeply nested is hard for readers to understand,
so we should move pieces of long functions into small ones.

```python
# ...before...
def check_neighbors(grid, point):
    if (0 < point.x) and (point.x < grid.width-1) and \
       (0 < point.y) and (point.y < grid.height-1):
        # ...look at all four neighbors
```

```python
# ...after..
def check_neighbors(grid, point):
    if in_interior(grid, point):
        # ...look at all four neighbors...

def in_interior(grid, point):
    return \
    (0 < point.x) and (point.x < grid.width-1) and \
    (0 < point.y) and (point.y < grid.height-1)
```

We should *always* extract functions when code can be re-used.
Even if they are only used once,
multi-part conditionals,
long equations,
and the bodies of loops are good candidates for extraction.
If we can't think of a plausible name,
or if a lot of data has to be passed into the function after it's extracted,
the code should probably be left where it is.
Finally,
it's often helpful to keep using the original variable names as parameter names during refactoring
to reduce typing.

### Combine operations in functions

"Combine functions" is the opposite of "extract function."
If operations are always done together,
it can sometimes be be more efficient to do them together,
and might be easier to understand.
However,
combining functions often reduces their reusability and readability.
(One sign that functions shouldn't have been combined is
people using the combination and throwing some of the result away.)

The fragment below shows how two functions can be combined:

```python
# ...before...
def count_vowels(text):
    num = 0
    for char in text:
        if char in VOWELS:
            num += 1
    return num

def count_consonants(text):
    num = 0
    for char in text:
        if char in CONSONANTS:
            num += 1
    return num
```

```python
# ...after...
def count_vowels_and_consonants(text):
    num_vowels = 0
    num_consonants = 0
    for char in text:
        if char in VOWELS:
            num_vowels += 1
        elif char in CONSONANTS:
            num_consonants += 1
    return num_vowels, num_consonants
```

### Replace code with data

It is easier to understand and maintain lookup tables than complicated conditionals,
so the "create lookup table" refactoring tells us to turn the latter into the former:

```python
# ...before..
def count_vowels_and_consonants(text):
    num_vowels = 0
    num_consonants = 0
    for char in text:
        if char in VOWELS:
            num_vowels += 1
        elif char in CONSONANTS:
            num_consonants += 1
    return num_vowels, num_consonants
```

```python
# ...after...
IS_VOWEL = {'a' : 1, 'b' : 0, 'c' : 0, ... }
IS_CONSONANT = {'a' : 0, 'b' : 1, 'c' : 1, ... }

def count_vowels_and_consonants(text):
    num_vowels = num_consonants = 0
    for char in text:
        num_vowels += IS_VOWEL[char]
        num_consonants += IS_CONSONANT[char]
    return num_vowels, num_consonants
```

The more cases there are,
the greater the advantage lookup tables have over multi-part conditionals.
Those advantages multiply when items can belong to more than one category,
in which case the table is often best written as a dictionary with items as keys
and sets of categories as values:

```python
LETTERS = {
    'A' : {'vowel', 'upper_case'},
    'B' : {'consonant', 'upper_case'},
    # ...other upper-case letters...
    'a' : {'vowel', 'lower_case'},
    'b' : {'consonant', 'lower_case'},
    # ...other lower-case letters...
    '+' : {'punctuation'},
    '@' : {'punctuation'},
    # ...other punctuation...
}

def count_vowels_and_consonants(text):
    num_vowels = num_consonants = 0
    for char in text:
        num_vowels += int('vowel' in LETTERS[char])
        num_consonants += int('consonant' in LETTERS[char])
    return num_vowels, num_consonants
```

The expressions used to update `num_vowels` and `num_consonants` make use of the fact that
`in` produces either `True` or `False`,
which the function `int` converts to either 1 or 0.
We will explore ways of making this code more readable in the exercises.

## Code Reviews {#style-review}

At the end of SectionÂ \@ref(style-check),
our stop-word program looked like this:

```python
import sys


stops = ['a', 'A', 'the', 'The', 'and']


def count(ln):
    n = 0
    for i in range(len(ln)):
        line = ln[i]
        stuff = line.split()
        for word in stuff:
            # print(word)
            j = stops.count(word)
            if j > 0:
                n = n + 1
    return n


lines = sys.stdin.readlines()
# print('number of lines', len(lines))
n = count(lines)
print('number', n)
```

This passes a PEP-8 style check,
but based on our coding guidelines and our discussion of refactoring,
these things should be changed:

-   The commented-out `print` statements should either be removed
    or turned into logging statements (SectionÂ \@ref(errors-logging)).

-   The variables `ln`, `i`, and `j` should be given clearer names.

-   The outer loop in `count` loops over the indices of the line list
    rather than over the lines.
    It should do the latter
    (which will allow us to get rid of the variable `i`).

-   Rather than counting how often a word occurs in the list of stop words with `stops.count`,
    we can turn the stop words into a set and use `in` to check words.
    This will be more readable *and* more efficient.

-   There's no reason to store the result of `line.split` in a temporary variable:
    the inner loop of `count` can use it directly.

-   Since the set of stop words is a global variable,
    it should be written in upper case.

-   We should use `+=` to increment the counter `n`.

-   Rather than reading the input into a list of lines and then looping over that,
    we can give `count` a stream and have it process the lines one by one.

-   Since we might want to use `count` in other programs someday,
    we should put the two lines at the bottom that handle input into a conditional
    so that they aren't executed when this script is imported.

After making all these changes,
our program looks like this:

```python
import sys


STOPS = {'a', 'A', 'the', 'The', 'and'}


def count(reader):
    n = 0
    for line in reader:
        for word in line.split():
            if word in STOPS:
                n += 1
    return n


if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = count(sys.stdin)
    print('number', n)
```

Reading code in order to find bugs and suggest improvements like these
is called \gref{code review}{code_review}.\index{code review}
Multiple studies over more than 40 years have shown that
code review is the most effective way to find bugs in software
[@Faga1976; @Faga1986; @Cohe2010; @Bacc2013].
It is also a great way to transfer knowledge between programmers:
reading someone else's code critically will give us lots of ideas about what we could do better,
and highlight things that we should probably stop doing as well.

Despite this,
code review still isn't common in research software development.
This is partly a chicken-and-egg problem:
people don't do it because other people don't do it [@Sega2005].
Code review is also more difficult to do in specialized scientific fields:
in order for review to be useful,
reviewers need to understand the problem domain well enough to comment on algorithms and design choices
rather than indentation and variable naming,
and the number of people who can do that for a research project is often very small [@Petr2014].

SectionÂ \@ref(git-advanced-pull-requests) explained how to create and merge pull requests.
How we review these is just as important as what we look for:
being dismissive or combative are good ways to ensure that people don't pay attention to our reviews,
or avoid having us review their work [@Bern2018].
Equally,
being defensive when someone offers suggestions politely and sincerely is very human,
but can stunt our development as a programmer.

Lots of people have written guidelines for doing reviews that avoid these traps [@Quen2018; @Sank2018].
A few common points are:

Work in small increments.
:   As @Cohe2010 and others have found,
    code review is most effective when done in short bursts.
    That means that change requests should also be short:
    anything that's more than a couple of screens long
    should be broken into smaller pieces.

Look for algorithmic problems first.
:   Code review isn't just (or even primarily) about style:
    its real purpose is to find bugs before they can affect anyone.
    The first pass over any change should therefore look for algorithmic problems.
    Are the calculations right?
    Are any rare cases going to be missed?
    Are errors being caught and handled (ChapterÂ \@ref(errors))?
    Using a consistent style helps reviewers focus on these issues.

Use a checklist.
:   Linters are great,
    but can't decide when someone should have used a lookup table instead of conditionals.
    A list of things to check for can make review faster and more comprehensible,
    especially when we can copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop specific comments
    onto specific lines
    (something that GitHub unfortunately doesn't yet support).

Ask for clarification.
:   If we don't understand something,
    or don't understand why the author did it,
    we should ask.
    (When the author explains it,
    we might suggest that the explanation should be documented somewhere.)

Offer alternatives.
:   Telling authors that something is wrong is helpful;
    telling them what they might do instead is more so.

Don't be sarcastic or disparaging.
:   "Did you maybe think about *testing* this garbage?"
    is a Code of Conduct violation in any well-run project.

Don't present opinions as facts.
:   "Nobody uses X anymore" might be true.
    If it is,
    the person making the claim ought to be able to point at download statistics
    or a Google Trends search;
    if they can't,
    they should say,
    "I don't think we use X anymore" and explain why they think that.

Don't feign surprise or pass judgment.
:   "Gosh, didn't you know [some obscure fact]?" isn't helpful;
    neither is, "Geez, why don't you [some clever trick] here?"

Don't overwhelm people with details.
:   If someone has used the letter `x` as a variable name in several places,
    and they shouldn't have,
    comment on the first two or three and simply put a check beside the others---the reader
    won't need the comment repeated.

Don't try to sneak in feature requests.
:   Nobody enjoys fixing bugs and style violations.
    Asking them to add entirely new functionality while they're at it is rude.

How we respond to reviews is just as important:

Be specific in replies to reviewers.
:   If someone has suggested a better variable name,
    we can probably simply fix it.
    If someone has suggested a major overhaul to an algorithm,
    we should reply to their comment to point at the commit that includes the fix.

Thank our reviewers.
:   If someone has taken the time to read our code carefully,
    thank them for doing it.

And finally:

**Don't let anyone break these rules just because they're frequent contributors or in positions of power.**
As @Grue2015 says,
the culture of any organization is shaped by the worst behavior it is willing to tolerate.
The main figures in a project should be *more* respectful than everyone else
in order to show what standards everyone else is expected to meet.

## Python Features {#style-features}

\gref{Working memory}{working_memory} can only hold a few items at once:
initial estimates in the 1950s put the number at 7Â±2 [@Mill1956],
and more recent estimates put it as low as 4 or 5.
High-level languages from Fortran to Python
are essentially a way to reduce the number of things programmers have to think about at once
so that they can fit what the computer is doing into this limited space.
The sections below describe some of these features;
as we become more comfortable with Python we will find and use others.

But beware:
the things that make programs more compact and comprehensible for experienced programmers
can make them less comprehensible for novices.
For example,
suppose we want to create this matrix as a list of lists:

```python
[[0, 1, 2, 3, 4],
 [1, 2, 3, 4, 5],
 [2, 3, 4, 5, 6],
 [3, 4, 5, 6, 7],
 [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]]
```

One way is to use loops:

```python
matrix = []
for i in range(5):
    row = []
    for j in range(5):
        row.append(i+j)
    matrix.append(row)
```

Another is to use a nested \gref{list comprehension}{list_comprehension}:\index{list comprehension (in Python)}\index{Python!list comprehension}

```python
[[i+j for j in range(5)] for i in range(5)]
```

An experienced programmer might recognize what the latter is doing;
the rest of us are probably better off reading and writing the more verbose solution.

### Provide default values for parameters

If our function requires two dozen parameters,
the odds are very good that users will frequently forget them
or put them in the wrong order.
One solution is to bundle parameters together so that (for example)
people pass three `point` objects instead of nine separate `x`, `y`, and `z` values.

A second approach (which can be combined with the previous one)
is to specify \gref{default values}{default_value} for some of the parameters.\index{default value (for parameter)}\index{Python!default values for parameters}
Doing this gives users control over everything
while also allowing them to ignore details;
it also indicates what we consider "normal" for the function.

For example,
suppose we are comparing images to see if they are the same or different.
We can specify two kinds of tolerance:
how large a difference in color value to notice,
and how many differences above that threshold to tolerate
as a percentage of the total number of pixels.
By default,
any color difference is considered significant,
and only 1% of pixels are allowed to differ:

```python
def image_diff(left, right, per_pixel=0, fraction=0.01):
    # ...implementation...
```

When this function is called using `image_diff(old, new)`,
those default values apply.
However,
it can also be called like this:

-   `image_diff(old, new, per_pixel=2)`
    allows pixels to differ slightly without those differences being significant.
-   `image_diff(old, new, fraction=0.05)` allows more pixels to differ.
-   `image_diff(old, new, per_pixel=1, fraction=0.005)`
    raises the per-pixel threshold but decreases number of allowed differences.

Note that we do not put spaces around the `=` when defining a default parameter value.
This is consistent with PEP-8's rules about spacing in function definitions and calls
(SectionÂ \@ref(style-pep8)).

Default parameter values make code easier to understand and use,
but there is a subtle trap.
When Python executes a function definition like this:

```python
def collect(new_value, accumulator=set()):
    accumulator.add(new_value)
    return accumulator
```

it calls `set()` to create a new empty set
*when it is reading the function definition*,
and then uses that set as the default value for `accumulator`
every time the function is called.
It does *not* call `set()` once for each call,
so all calls using the default will share the same set:

```python
>>> collect('first')
{'first'}
>>> collect('second')
{'first', 'second'}
```

A common way to avoid this is to pass `None` to the function
to signal that the user didn't provide a value:

```python
def collect(new_value, accumulator=None):
    if accumulator is None:
        accumulator = set()
    accumulator.add(new_value)
    return accumulator
```

### Handle a variable number of arguments

We can often make programs simpler by writing functions that take
\gref{a variable number of arguments}{variable_arguments},\index{Python!variable arguments}
just like `print` and `max`.
One way is to require users to stuff those arguments into a list,
e.g.,
to write `find_limits([a, b, c, d])`.
However,
Python can do this for us.
If we declare a single argument whose name starts with a single `*`,
Python will put all "extra" arguments into a \gref{tuple}{tuple}\index{tuple (in Python)}\index{Python!tuple}
and pass that as the argument.
By convention,
this argument is called `args`:

```python
def find_limits(*args):
    print(args)

find_limits(1, 3, 5, 2, 4)
```

```text
(1, 3, 5, 2, 4)
```

This catch-all parameter can be used with regular parameters,
but must come last in the parameter list to avoid ambiguity:

```python
def select_outside(low, high, *values):
    result = []
    for v in values:
        if (v < low) or (v > high):
            result.add(v)
    return result

print(select_outside(0, 1.0, 0.3, -0.2, -0.5, 0.4, 1.7))
```

```text
[-0.2, -0.5, 1.7]
```

An equivalent special form exists for \gref{keyword arguments}{keyword_arguments}:
the catch-all variable's name is prefixed with `**` (i.e., two asterisks instead of one),
and it is conventionally called `kwargs` (for "keyword arguments").\index{Python!keyword arguments}\index{keyword arguments (in Python)}
When this is used,
the function is given a \gref{dictionary}{dictionary} of names and values
rather than a list:

```python
def set_options(tag, **kwargs):
    result = f'<{tag}'
    for key in kwargs:
        result += f' {key}="{kwargs[key]}"'
    result += '/>'
    return result

print(set_options('h1', color='blue'))
print(set_options('p', align='center', size='150%'))
```

```text
<h1 color="blue"/>
<p align="center" size="150%"/>
```

Notice that the names of parameters are not quoted:
we pass `color='blue'` to the function,
not `'color'='blue'`.

### Unpacking variable arguments

We can use the inverse of `*args` and `**kwargs` to match a list of values to arguments.
In this case,
we put the `*` in front of a list and `**` in front of a dictionary when *calling* the function,
rather than in front of the parameter when *defining* it:

```python
def trim_value(data, low, high):
    print(data, "with", low, "and", high)

parameters = ['some matrix', 'lower bound']
named_parameters = {'high': 'upper bound'}
trim_value(*parameters, **named_parameters)
```

```text
some matrix with lower bound and upper bound
```

### Use destructuring to assign multiple values at once

One last feature of Python is
\gref{destructuring assignment}{destructuring_assignment}.\index{Python!destructuring assignment}\index{destructuring assignment (in Python)}
Suppose we have a nested list such as `[1, [2, 3]]`,
and we want to assign its numbers to three variables
called `first`, `second`, and `third`.
Instead of writing this:

```python
first = values[0]
second = values[1][0]
third = values[1][1]
```

we can write this:

```python
[first, [second, third]] = [1, [2, 3]]
```

In general,
if the variables on the left are arranged in the same way as the values on the right,
Python will automatically unpack the values and assign them correctly.
This is particularly useful when looping over lists of structured values:

```python
people = [
    [['Kay', 'McNulty'], 'mcnulty@eniac.org'],
    [['Betty', 'Jennings'], 'jennings@eniac.org'],
    [['Marlyn', 'Wescoff'], 'mwescoff@eniac.org']
]
for [[first, last], email] in people:
    print('{first} {last} <{email}>')
```

```text
Kay McNulty <mcnulty@eniac.org>
Betty Jennings <jennings@eniac.org>
Marlyn Wescoff <mwescoff@eniac.org>
```

## Summary {#style-summary}

George Orwell laid out [six rules for good writing][orwells-rules],
the last and most important of which is,
"Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous."
PEP-8 conveys [the same message][pep-8-hobgoblin]:
there will always be cases where your code will be easier to understand
if you *don't* do the things described in this lesson,
but there are probably fewer of them than you think.

# Documenting Programs {#documentation}

An old proverb says, "Trust, but verify."
The equivalent in programming is, "Be clear, but document."
No matter how well software is written,
it always embodies decisions that aren't explicit in the final code
or accommodates complications that aren't going to be obvious to the next reader.
Putting it another way,
the best function names in the world aren't going to answer the questions
"Why does the software do this?"
and
"Why doesn't it do this in a simpler way?"

In this appendix we address some issues that commonly arise
when people start to think about documenting their software.
We start with tips for writing good docstrings,
before considering more detailed documentation
like tutorials, cookbooks and frequently asked question
(\gref{FAQ}{faq}\index{FAQ (Frequency Asked Questions)}\index{Python package!FAQ}) lists.
Clearly defining your audience can make it easier to determine
which types of documentation you need to provide,
and there are a number of things you can do to reduce the
work involved in providing support for FAQs. 

## Writing Good Docstrings {#documentation-docstrings}

If we are doing \gref{exploratory programming}{exploratory_programming},
a short \gref{docstring}{docstring} to remind ourselves of each function's purpose\index{docstring (in Python)}\index{Python!docstring}
is probably as much documentation as we need.
(In fact, it's probably better than what most people do.)
That one- or two-liner should begin with an active verb and describe either
how inputs are turned into outputs,
or what side effects the function has;
as we discuss below,
if we need to describe both,
we should probably rewrite our function.

An active verb is something like "extract", "normalize", or "plot".
For example,
here's a function that calculates someone's age from their birthday,
which uses a one-line docstring beginning with the active verb "find": 

```python
import re
from datetime import date


def calculate_age(birthday):
    """Find current age from birth date."""
    valid_date = '([0-9]{4})-([0-9]{2})-([0-9]{2})$'
    if not bool(re.search(valid_date, birthday)):
        message = 'Birthday must be in YYYY-MM-DD format'
        raise ValueError(message)
    today = date.today()
    born = date.fromisoformat(birthday)
    no_bday_this_year_yet = (today.month,
                             today.day) < (born.month,
                                           born.day)
    age = today.year - born.year - no_bday_this_year_yet
    return age
```

Other examples of good one-line docstrings include:

-   "Create a list of capital cities from a list of countries."
-   "Clip signals to lie in [0...1]."
-   "Reduce the red component of each pixel."

We can tell our one-liners are useful if we can read them aloud in the order the functions are called
in place of the function's name and parameters.

Once we start writing code for other people (or our future selves)
our docstrings should include:

1.  The name and purpose of every public class, function, and constant in our code.
2.  The name, purpose, and default value (if any) of every parameter to every function.
3.  Any side effects the function has.
4.  The type of value returned by every function.
5.  What exceptions those functions can raise and when.

The word "public" in the first rule is important.
We don't have to write full documentation for helper functions
that are only used inside our package and aren't meant to be called by users,
but these should still have at least a comment explaining their purpose.

Here's the previous function with a more complete docstring:

```python
def calculate_age(birthday):
    """Find current age from birth date.
    
    :param birthday str: birth date
    :returns: age in years
    :rtype: int
    :raises ValueError: if birthday not in YYYY-MM-DD format
    """
```

We could format and organize the information in the docstring any way we like,
but here we've decided to use \gref{reStructuredText}{restructured_text},
which is the default plain-text markup format supported by [Sphinx][sphinx]
(Section \@ref(packaging-document)).
The [Sphinx documentation][sphinx-docstring-docs] describes the precise syntax for
parameters, returns, exceptions and other items that are typically included
in a docstring.

While the reStructuredText docstring format suggested in the Sphinx documentation
looks nice once Sphinx parses and converts it to HTML for the web,
the code itself is somewhat dense and hard to read.
To address this issue,
a number of different formats have been proposed.
Two of the most prominent are [Google style][google-style]:

```python
def calculate_age(birthday):
    """Find current age from birth date.
    
    Args:
        birthday (str): birth date.
    
    Returns:
        Age in years.
    
    Raises:
        ValueError: If birthday not in YYYY-MM-DD format.
    """
``` 

and [`numpydoc` style][numpydoc]:

```python
def calculate_age(birthday):
    """Find current age from birth date.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    birthday : string
        birth date

    Returns
    -------
    integer
        age in years

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        if birthday not in YYYY-MM-DD format
    """
```

These two formats have become so popular that a Sphinx extension
called [Napoleon][napoleon] has been released.
It parses `numpydoc` and Google style docstrings and converts them to reStructuredText
before Sphinx attempts to parse them.
This happens in an intermediate step while Sphinx is processing the documentation,
so it doesnât modify any of the docstrings in your actual source code files.
The choice between the `numpydoc` and Google styles is largely aesthetic,
but the two styles should not be mixed.
Choose one style for your project and be consistent with it.

## Defining Your Audience {#documentation-audience}

It's important to consider who documentation is for.
There are three kinds of people in any domain:
\gref{novices}{novice},
\gref{competent practitioners}{competent_practitioner},
and \gref{experts}{expert} [@Wils2018].
A novice doesn't yet have a \gref{mental model}{mental_model} of the domain:
they don't know what the key terms are,
how they relate,
what the causes of their problems are,
or how to tell whether a solution to their problem is appropriate or not.

Competent practitioners know enough to accomplish routine tasks with routine effort:
they may need to check [Stack Overflow][stack-overflow] every few minutes,
but they know what to search for and what "done" looks like.

Finally,
experts have such a deep and broad understanding of the domain
that they can solve routine problems at a glance
and are able to handle the one-in-a-thousand cases
that would baffle the merely competent.

Each of these three groups needs a different kind of documentation:

-   A novice needs a tutorial that introduces her to key ideas one by one
    and shows how they fit together.

-   A competent practitioner needs reference guides, cookbooks, and Q&A sites;
    these give her solutions close enough to what she needs
    that she can tweak them the rest of the way.

-   Experts need this material as well---nobody's memory is perfect---but
    they may also paradoxically want tutorials.
    The difference between them and novices is that experts want tutorials on how things work
    and why they were designed that way.

The first thing to decide when writing documentation
is therefore to decide which of these needs we are trying to meet.
Tutorials like this book should be long-form prose that contain code samples and diagrams.
They should use \gref{authentic tasks}{authentic_task} to motivate ideas,
i.e.,
show people things they actually want to do rather than printing the numbers from 1 to 10,
and should include regular check-ins
so that learners and instructors alike can tell if they're making progress.

Tutorials help novices build a mental model,
but competent practitioners and experts will be frustrated by their slow pace and low information density.
They will want single-point solutions to specific problems,
like how to find cells in a spreadsheet that contain a certain string
or how to configure the web server to load an access control module.
They can make use of an alphabetical list of the functions in a library,
but are much happier if they can search by keyword to find what they need;
one of the signs that someone is no longer a novice is that
they're able to compose useful queries and tell if the results are on the right track or not.

> **False Beginners**
>
> A \gref{false beginner}{false_beginner} is someone who appears not to know anything,
> but who has enough prior experience in other domains
> to be able to piece things together much more quickly than a genuine novice.
> Someone who is proficient with MATLAB, for example,
> will speed through a tutorial on Python's numerical libraries
> much more quickly than someone who has never programmed before.
> Creating documentation for false beginners is especially challenging;
> if resources permit,
> the best option is often a translation guide
> that shows them how they would do a task with the system they know well
> and then how to do the equivalent task with the new system.

In an ideal world,
we would satisfy these needs with a chorus of explanations [@Caul2016],
some long and detailed,
others short and to the point.
In our world, though,
time and resources are limited,
so all but the most popular packages must make do with single explanations.

## Creating an FAQ {#documentation-faq}

As projects grow,
documentation within functions alone may be insufficient for users to apply code to their own problems.
One strategy to assist other people with understanding a project is with
an \gref{FAQ}{faq}:
a list of frequently asked questions and corresponding answers.
A good FAQ uses the terms and concepts that people bring to the software
rather than the vocabulary of its authors;
putting it another way,
the questions should be things that people might search for online,
and the answers should give them enough information to solve their problem.

Creating and maintaining an FAQ is a lot of work,
and unless the community is large and active,
a lot of that effort may turn out to be wasted,
because it's hard for the authors or maintainers of a piece of software
to anticipate what newcomers will be mystified by.
A better approach is to leverage sites like [Stack Overflow][stack-overflow],
which is where most programmers are going to look for answers anyway:

1.  Post every question that someone actually asks us,
    whether it's online, by email, or in person.
    Be sure to include the name of the software package in the question
    so that it's findable.

2.  Answer the question,
    making sure to mention which version of the software we're talking about
    (so that people can easily spot and discard stale answers in the future).

The [Stack Overflow][stack-overflow] guide to [asking a good question][stack-overflow-good-question]
has been refined over many years,
and is a good guide for any project:

Write the most specific title we can.
:   "Why does division sometimes give a different result in Python 2.7 and Python 3.5?"
    is much better than, "Help! Math in Python!!"

Give context before giving sample code.
:   A few sentences to explain what we are trying to do
    and why it will help people determine if their question is a close match to ours or not.

Provide a minimal reprex.
:   SectionÂ \@ref(teams-bugs) explains the value of a \gref{reproducible example}{reprex},
    and why reprexes should be as short as possible.
    Readers will have a much easier time figuring out if this question and its answers are for them
    if they can see *and understand* a few lines of code.

Tag, tag, tag.\index{tags (for documentation)}
:   Keywords make everything more findable,
    from scientific papers to left-handed musical instruments.

Use "I" and question words (how/what/when/where/why).
:   Writing this way forces us to think more clearly about
    what someone might actually be thinking when they need help.

Keep each item short.
:   The "minimal manual" approach to instructional design [@Carr2014]
    breaks everything down into single-page steps,
    with half of that page devoted to troubleshooting.
    This may feel trivializing to the person doing the writing,
    but is often as much as a person searching and reading can handle.
    It also helps writers realize just how much implicit knowledge they are assuming.

Allow for a chorus of explanations.
:   As discussed earlier,
    users are all different from one another,
    and are therefore best served by a chorus of explanations.
    Do not be afraid of providing multiple explanations to a single question
    that suggest different approaches
    or are written for different prior levels of understanding.

# YAML {#yaml}

\gref{YAML}{yaml_glossary}\index{YAML} is a way to write nested data structures in plain text
that is often used to specify configuration options for software.
The acronym stands for "YAML Ain't Markup Language,"
but that's misleading:
YAML doesn't use tags like HTML,
but can still be quite fussy about what is allowed to appear where.

Throughout this book we use YAML to
configure our plotting script (Chapter \@ref(config)),
continuous integration with Travis CI (Section \@ref(testing-ci)),
software environment with `conda` (Section \@ref(provenance-code-environment)),
and a documentation website with Read the Docs (Section \@ref(packaging-rtd)).
While you don't need to be an expert in YAML to complete tasks like these,
this appendix outlines some basics that can help make things easier.

A simple YAML file has one key-value pair on each line
with a colon separating the key from the value:

```yaml
project-name: planet earth
purpose: science fair
moons: 1
```

Here,
the keys are `"project-name"`, `"purpose"`, and `"moons"`,
and the values are `"planet earth"`,
`"science fair"`,
and (hopefully) the number 1,
since most YAML implementations try to guess the type of data.

If we want to create a list of values without keys,
we can write it either using square brackets (like a Python array)
or dashed items (like a Markdown\index{Markdown} list),
so:

```yaml
rotation-time: ["1 year", "12 months", "365.25 days"]
```

and:

```yaml
rotation-time:
    - 1 year
    - 12 months
    - 365.25 days
```

are equivalent.
(The indentation isn't absolutely required in this case,
but helps make the intention clear.)
If we want to write entire paragraphs,
we can use a marker to show that a value spans multiple lines:

```yaml
feedback: |
    Neat molten core concept.
    Too much water.
    Could have used more imaginative ending.
```

We can also add comments using `#` just as we do in many programming languages.

YAML is easy to understand when used this way,
but it starts to get tricky as soon as sub-lists and sub-keys appear.
For example,
this is part of the YAML configuration file for formatting this book:

```yaml
bookdown::gitbook:
  highlight: tango
  config:
    download: ["pdf", "epub"]
    toc:
      collapse: section
      before: |
        <li><a href="./">Merely Useful</a></li>
    sharing: no
```

It corresponds to the following Python data structure:

```python
{
  'bookdown::gitbook': {
    'highlight': 'tango',
    'config': {
      'download': [
        'pdf',
        'epub'
      ],
      'toc': {
        'collapse': 'section',
        'before': '<li><a href="./">Merely Useful</a></li>\n'
      }
      'sharing': False
    }
  }
}
```

# Anaconda {#anaconda}

When people first started using Python for data science,
installing the relevant libraries could be difficult.\index{package installation}
The main problem was that the Python package installer ([`pip`][pip])\index{pip}
only worked for libraries written in pure Python.
Many scientific Python libraries have C and/or Fortran dependencies,
so it was left up to data scientists
(who often do not have a background in system administration)
to figure out how to install those dependencies themselves.
To overcome this problem,
a number of scientific Python \gref{distributions}{software_distribution}\index{Python distribution}
have been released over the years.
These come with the most popular data science libraries and their dependencies pre-installed,
and some also come with a package manager to assist
with installing additional libraries that weren't pre-installed.
Today the most popular distribution for data science is [Anaconda][anaconda],\index{Anaconda}
which comes with a package (and environment) manager called [`conda`][conda].\index{conda}
In this appendix we look at some of the most important features of `conda`
for research software engineers.

## Package Management with conda {#anaconda-conda-package-management}

According to the [latest documentation][anaconda-docs],
Anaconda comes with over 250 of the most widely used data science libraries (and their dependencies) pre-installed.
In addition, there are several thousand libraries available via the `conda install` command,
which can be executed at the command line or by using the Anaconda Navigator graphical user interface.
A package manager like conda greatly simplifies the software installation process
by identifying and installing compatible versions of software and all required dependencies.
It also handles the process of updating software as more recent versions become available.
If you don't want to install the entire Anaconda distribution,
you can install [Miniconda][miniconda]\index{miniconda} instead.
It essentially comes with `conda` and nothing else.

### Anaconda Cloud {#anaconda-cloud}

What happens if we want to install a Python package
that isn't on the list of the few thousand or so most popular data science packages
(i.e., the ones that are automatically available via the `conda install` command)?
The answer is the [Anaconda Cloud][anaconda-cloud] website,
where the community can post `conda` installation packages.

The utility of the Anaconda Cloud for research software engineers
is best illustrated by an example.
A few years ago, an atmospheric scientist by the name of Andrew Dawson
wrote a Python package called [`windspharm`][windspharm]
for performing computations on global wind fields in spherical geometry.
While many of Andrew's colleagues routinely process global wind fields,
atmospheric science is a relatively small field and thus the `windspharm` package
will never have a big enough user base to make the list of
popular data science packages supported by Anaconda.
Andrew has therefore posted a `conda` installation package to Anaconda Cloud
(FigureÂ \@ref(fig:anaconda-windspharm-ajdawson))
so that users can install `windspharm` using `conda`:

```bash
$ conda install -c ajdawson windspharm
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/anaconda/cloud-windspharm-ajdawson.png" alt="The windspharm conda installation package on Anaconda Cloud." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:anaconda-windspharm-ajdawson)The windspharm conda installation package on Anaconda Cloud.</p>
</div>

The `conda` documentation has [instructions][conda-skeleton-pypi] for quickly building
a `conda` package for a Python module that is already available on [PyPI][pypi]
(SectionÂ \@ref(packaging-distribute)).

### conda-forge

It turns out there are often multiple installation packages for the same library
up on Anaconda Cloud (e.g., FigureÂ \@ref(fig:anaconda-windspharm-search)).
To try and address this duplication problem, [conda-forge][conda-forge] was launched.
It aims to be a central repository that contains just a single, up-to-date (and working)
version of each installation package on Anaconda Cloud.
You can therefore expand the selection of packages available via `conda install`
beyond the chosen few thousand by adding the conda-forge channel to your `conda` configuration:

```bash
$ conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figures/anaconda/cloud-windspharm-search.png" alt="Search results for the windspharm package on Anaconda Cloud." width="100%" />
<p class="caption">(\#fig:anaconda-windspharm-search)Search results for the windspharm package on Anaconda Cloud.</p>
</div>

The conda-forge website has [instructions][conda-forge-instructions]
for adding a `conda` installation package to the conda-forge repository.

## Environment Management with conda {#anaconda-environments}

If you are working on several data science projects at once,
installing all the libraries you need in the same place
(i.e., the system default location) can become problematic.
This is especially true if the projects rely on different versions of the same package,
or if you are developing a new package and need to try new things.
The way to avoid these issues is to create different
\gref{virtual environments}{virtual_environment}\index{virtual environment (in Python)} for different projects/tasks.
The original environment manager for Python development was [`virtualenv`][virtualenv],
which has been more recently superseded by [`pipenv`][pipenv].
The advantage that `conda` has over these options is that it is language agnostic
(i.e., you can isolate non-Python packages in your environments too) and
supports binary packages (i.e., you don't need to compile the source code after installing),
so it has become the environment manager of choice in data science.
In this book `conda` is used to export the details of an environment
when documenting the computational methodology for a report (SectionÂ \@ref(provenance-code))
and to test how a new package installs without disturbing anything
in our main Python installation (SectionÂ \@ref(packaging-virtualenv)).

# Glossary {#glossary}

**abandonware**<a id="abandonware"></a>
:   Software that is no longer being maintained.

**absolute error**<a id="absolute_error"></a>
:   The absolute value of the difference between the observed and the correct value. Absolute error is usually less useful than \gref{relative error}{relative_error}.

**absolute import**<a id="absolute_import"></a>
:   In Python, an import that specifies the full location of the file to be imported.

**absolute path**<a id="absolute_path"></a>
:   A path that points to the same location in the \gref{filesystem}{filesystem} regardless of where it is evaluated. An absolute path is the equivalent of latitude and longitude in geography. See also: [relative path](#relative_path)

**actual result (of test)**<a id="actual_result"></a>
:   The value generated by running code in a test. If this matches the \gref{expected result}{expected_result}, the test \gref{passes}{pass_test}; if the two are different, the test \gref{fails}{fail_test}.

**agile development**<a id="agile"></a>
:   A software development methodology that emphasizes lots of small steps and continuous feedback instead of up-front planning and long-term scheduling. \gref{Exploratory programming}{exploratory_programming} is often agile.

**ally**<a id="ally"></a>
:   Someone who actively promotes and supports inclusivity.

**append mode**<a id="append_mode"></a>
:   To add data to the end of an existing file instead of overwriting the previous contents of that file. Overwriting is the default, so most programming languages require programs to be explicit about wanting to append instead.

**assertion**<a id="assertion"></a>
:   A \gref{Boolean}{boolean} expression that must be \gref{true}{true} at a certain point in a program. Assertions may be built into the language (e.g., \gref{Python}{python}'s `assert` statement) or provided as functions (e.g., \gref{R}{r_language}'s `stopifnot`). They are often used in testing, but are also put in \gref{production code}{production_code} to check that it is behaving correctly. In many languages, assertions should not be used to perform data validation as they may be silently dropped by compilers and interpreters under optimization conditions. Using assertions for data validation can therefore introduce security risks. Unlike many languages, R does not have an `assert` statement which can be disabled, and so use of a \gref{package}{package} such as `assertr` for data validation does not create security holes.

**authentic task**<a id="authentic_task"></a>
:   A task which contains important elements of things that learners would do in real life (non-classroom situations).

**auto-completion**<a id="auto_completion"></a>
:   A feature that allows the user to finish a word or code quickly by pressing the TAB key to list possible words or code from which the user can select.

**automatic variable**<a id="automatic_variable"></a>
:   A variable that is automatically given a value in a \gref{build rule}{build_rule}. For example, Make automatically assigns the name of a rule's \gref{target}{build_target} to the automatic variable `$@`. Automatic variables are frequently used when writing \gref{pattern rules}{pattern_rule}. See also: [Makefile](#makefile)

**boilerplate**<a id="boilerplate"></a>
:   Standard text that is included in legal contracts, licenses, and so on.

**branch-per-feature workflow**<a id="branch_per_feature_workflow"></a>
:   A common strategy for managing work with \gref{Git}{git} and other \gref{version control systems}{version_control_system} in which a separate \gref{branch}{git_branch} is created for work on each new feature or each \gref{bug}{bug} fix and merged when that work is completed. This isolates changes from one another until they are completed.

**bug report**<a id="bug_report"></a>
:   A collection of files, \gref{logs}{log}, or related information that describes either an unexpected output of some code or program, or an unexpected error or warning. This information is used to help find and fix a \gref{bug}{bug} in the program or code.

**bug tracker**<a id="bug_tracker"></a>
:   A system that tracks and manages \gref{reported bugs}{bug_report} for a software program, to make it easier to address and fix the \gref{bugs}{bug}.

**build manager**<a id="build_manager"></a>
:   A program that keeps track of how files depend on one another and runs commands to update any files that are out-of-date. Build managers were invented to \gref{compile}{compile} only those parts of programs that had changed, but are now often used to implement workflows in which plots depend on results files, which in turn depend on raw data files or configuration files. See also: [build rule](#build_rule), [Makefile](#makefile)

**build recipe**<a id="build_recipe"></a>
:   The part of a \gref{build rule}{build_rule} that describes how to update something that has fallen out-of-date.

**build rule**<a id="build_rule"></a>
:   A specification for a \gref{build manager}{build_manager} that describes how some files depend on others and what to do if those files are out-of-date.

**build target**<a id="build_target"></a>
:   The file(s) that a \gref{build rule}{build_rule} will update if they are out-of-date compared to their \gref{dependencies}{dependency}. See also: [Makefile](#makefile), [default target](#default_target)

**byte code**<a id="byte_code"></a>
:   A set of instructions designed to be executed efficiently by an \gref{interpreter}{interpreter}.

**call stack**<a id="call_stack"></a>
:   A data structure that stores information about the active subroutines executed.

**camel case**<a id="camel_case"></a>
:   A style of writing code that involves naming variables and objects with no space, underscore (`_`), dot (`.`), or dash (`-`) characters, with each word being capitalized. Examples include `CalculateSum` and `findPattern`. See also: [kebab case](#kebab_case), [pothole case](#pothole_case)

**catch (an exception)**<a id="catch_exception"></a>
:   To accept responsibility for handling an error or other unexpected event. \gref{R}{r_language} prefers "handling a condition" to "catching an exception." \gref{Python}{python}, on the other hand, encourages raising and catching exceptions, and in some situations, requires it.

**Creative Commons license**<a id="cc_license"></a>
:   A set of \gref{licenses}{license} that can be applied to published work. Each license is formed by concatenating one or more of `-BY` (Attribution): users must cite the original source; `-SA` (ShareAlike): users must share their own work under a similar license; `-NC` (NonCommercial): work may not be used for commercial purposes without the creator's permission; `-ND` (NoDerivatives): no derivative works (e.g., translations) can be created without the creator's permission. Thus, `CC-BY-NC` means "users must give attribution and cannot use commercially without permission." The term `CC-0` (zero, not letter 'O') is sometimes used to mean "no restrictions," i.e., the work is in the public domain.

**checklist**<a id="checklist"></a>
:   A list of things to be checked or completed when doing a task.

**command-line interface**<a id="cli"></a>
:   A user interface that relies solely on text for commands and output, typically running in a \gref{shell}{shell}.

**code coverage (in testing)**<a id="code_coverage"></a>
:   How much of a \gref{library}{library} or program is executed when tests run. This is normally reported as a percentage of lines of code: for example, if 40 out of 50 lines in a file are run during testing, those tests have 80% code coverage.

**code review**<a id="code_review"></a>
:   To check a program or a change to a program by inspecting its source code.

**cognitive load**<a id="cognitive_load"></a>
