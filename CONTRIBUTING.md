# Contributing {#contributing}

Contributions of all kinds are welcome, from errata and minor improvements to
entirely new sections and chapters: please [email us][config-email] or submit an
issue or pull request to [our GitHub repository][config-repo].  Everyone whose
work is incorporated will be acknowledged; please note that all contributors are
required to abide by our Code of Conduct.

Please note that we use Simplified English rather than Traditional English,
i.e., American rather than British spelling and grammar.  We encourage
translations; if you would like to take this on, please [email
us][config-email].

If you wish to report errata or suggest improvements to wording, please include
the chapter name in the first line of the body of your report (e.g., `Testing
Data Analysis`).

Code style conventions can be found in [./style-guide-for-authors.Rmd].
