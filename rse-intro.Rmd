# RSE Introduction {#rse-intro}

As research becomes more computing intensive,
researchers need more computing skills so that:

-   other people (including your future self) can re-do your analyses;
-   you and the people using your results can be confident that they're correct; and
-   re-using your software is easier than rewriting it.

Most books and courses about software engineering are aimed at product development,
but research has different aims and needs.
A research programmer's goal is to answer a question;
she might build software in order to do that,
but the software is only a means to an end.

But just as some astronomers spend their entire careers designing better telescopes,
some researchers choose to spend their time building software
that will primarily be used by their colleagues.
People who do this may be called [research software engineers](glossary.html#rse) (RSEs)
or [data engineers](glossary.html#data-engineering),
and the aim of these lessons is to help you get ready for these roles---to go from
writing code on your own, for your own use,
to working in a small team creating tools to help your entire field advance.

One of the many challenges you will face is
to find the appropriate mix of tools and methods for each problem you have to solve.
If you want to reformat a handful of text files so that your program can read them in,
you shouldn't bother writing a comprehensive test suite or setting up automated builds.
On the other hand,
if you *don't* do this,
and that "handful of text files" turns into a pile,
and then a mountain,
you will quickly reach a point where you wish you had.
We hope this training will help you understand what challenges have already been solved
and where to find those solutions
so that when you need them,
you'll be able to find them.

## Who are these lessons for? {#rse-intro-personas}

Amira
:   completed a Master's in library science five years ago,
    and has worked since then for a small NGO.
    She did some statistics during her degree,
    and has learned some R and Python by doing data science courses online,
    but has no formal training in programming.
    Amira would like to tidy up the scripts, data sets, and reports she has created
    in order to share them with her colleagues.
    These lessons will show her how to do this and what "done" looks like.

Jun
:   completed an [Insight Data Science][insight] fellowship last year after doing a PhD in Geology,
    and now works for a company that does forensic audits.
    He has used a variety of machine learning and visualization software,
    and has made a few small contributions to a couple of open source R packages.
    He would now like to make his own code available to others;
    this guide will show him how such projects should be organized.

Sami
:   learned a fair bit of numerical programming while doing a BSc in applied math,
    then started working for the university's supercomputing center.
    Over the past few years,
    the kinds of applications they are being asked to support
    have shifted from fluid dynamics to data analysis.
    This guide will teach them how to build and run data pipelines
    so that they can teach those skills to their users.

### Summary

For researchers and data scientists who can build and run programs that are three or four pages long,
and who want to be more productive and have more confidence in their results,
this guide
provides a pragmatic, tools-based introduction to program design and maintenance.
Unlike books and courses aimed at computer scientists and professional software developers,
this guide uses data analysis as a motivating example
and assumes that the learner's ultimate goal is to answer questions rather than ship products.

### Prerequisites

Learners must be comfortable with the basics of
the [Unix shell][swc-shell], [Python][swc-python] or [R][swc-r], and [Git][swc-git].
They will need a personal computer with Internet access,
the Bash shell,
Python 3,
and a GitHub account.

## What does "done" look like? {#rse-intro-done}

In order to answer the question posed in this section's title,
we need to distinguish between three key ideas.
The first is [open science](glossary.html#open-science),
which aims to make research methods and results available for everyone to read and re-use.
The second is [reproducible research](glossary.html#reproducible-research),
which means that anyone with access to the raw materials can easily reproduce the results.
Openness and reproducibility are closely related,
but are *not* the same thing:

-   If you share my data and analysis scripts,
    but haven't documented the manual steps in the analysis,
    your work is open but not reproducible.
-   If you completely automate the analysis,
    but it's only available to people in you company or lab,
    it's reproducible but not open.

The third key idea is [sustainability](glossary.html#sustainability).
A piece of software is being sustained
if people are using it, fixing it, and improving it
rather than replacing it.
Sustainability isn't just a property of the software:
it also depends on the culture of its actual and potential users.
If "share, mend, and extend" is woven into the fabric of their culture,
even Fortran-77 can thrive
(though of course good tooling and packaging can lower costs and barriers to entry).
Conversely,
it doesn't matter whether a library has automated tests and is properly packaged
if potential users suffer from [Not Invented Here](glossary.html#not-invented-here) syndrome.
More importantly,
if the software is being maintained by a couple of post-docs
who are being paid a fraction of what they could earn in industry,
and who have no realistic hope of promotion because their field looks down on tool building,
those people will eventually move on
and their software will start to suffer from [bit rot](glossary.html#bit-rot).

What ties these three ideas together is the notion of
[computational competence](glossary.html#computational-competence),
which is the the programming equivalent of good laboratory skills.
Software is just another kind of lab equipment;
just as an archaeologist should know how to prepare and catalog an artefact,
any researcher writing software should know how to make their work reproducible
and share it with the world
without staying up until dawn.

> **Why "Computational Competence"?**
>
> The term [computational thinking](glossary.html#computational-thinking)
> has been widely used since @Wing2006 introduced it a decade ago.
> It has also been used in such a wide variety of ways
> that no one really knows what it means.
> We therefore prefer to talk about computational competence---about
> someone's ability to do computing well.

## What will this course accomplish? {#rse-intro-coverage}

The goal of this course is to help you produce more correct results in less time and with less effort:
stakeholders will be confident that you did things the right way,
which in turn will allow them to be confident in your results,
and you and others will be able to re-use your data, software, and reports instead of constantly rewriting them.
To achieve this, we will cover:

-   Writing code that is readable, testable, and maintainable
-   Automating analyses with build tools
-   Checking and demonstrating correctness via automated tests
-   Publishing science in the 21st Century
-   Using a branch-per-feature workflow, rebasing, and tags to manage work
-   Organizing the code, data, results, and reports in a small or medium-sized project

These lessons can be used for self-study
by people who are taking part in something like the [Insight Data Science][insight] Fellows Program,
or as part of a one-semester course for graduate students or senior undergraduates.
You will know you're done when:

1.  You are reasonably confident that your results are correct.
    This is not the same as "absolutely sure":
    our goal is to make digital work
    as trustworthy as lab experiments or careful manual analysis.
2.  Your software can be used by other people without heroic effort,
    I.e., people you have never met can find it
    and figure out how to install it and use it
    in less time than it would take them to write something themselves.
3.  Small changes and extensions are easy
    so that your software can grow as your problems and questions evolve.

## What will we use as running examples? {#rse-intro-example}

In order to make this material as accessible as possible,
we will use two text processing problems as running examples.
The first is an exploration of [Zipf's Law][zipfs-law],
which states that frequency of a word is inversely proportional to rank,
i.e.,
that the second most common word in some text
occurs half as often as most common,
the third most common occurs a third as often,
and so on.
We will write some simple software to test a corpus of text against this rule.
The files we will use are taken from the [Project Gutenberg][gutenberg]
and contain this many words:

| Book                            | Words  |
| ------------------------------- | -----: |
| anne_of_green_gables.txt        | 105642 |
| common_sense.txt                |  24999 |
| count_of_monte_cristo.txt       | 464226 |
| dracula.txt                     | 164424 |
| emma.txt                        | 160458 |
| ethan_frome.txt                 |  37732 |
| frankenstein.txt                |  78098 |
| jane_eyre.txt                   | 188455 |
| life_of_frederick_douglass.txt  |  43789 |
| moby_dick.txt                   | 215830 |
| mysterious_affair_at_styles.txt |  59604 |
| pride_and_prejudice.txt         | 124974 |
| sense_and_sensibility.txt       | 121590 |
| sherlock_holmes.txt             | 107533 |
| time_machine.txt                |  35524 |
| treasure_island.txt             |  71616 |

This is how often the most common words appear in this corpus as a whole:

| Word | Count |
| ---- | ----: |
| the  | 97278 |
| and  | 59385 |
| to   | 56028 |
| of   | 55190 |
| I    | 45680 |
| a    | 40483 |
| in   | 30030 |
| was  | 24512 |
| that | 24386 |
| you  | 22123 |
| it   | 21420 |

The frequencies aren't an exact match---we would expect about 48,600 occurrences of "and", for example---but
there certainly seems to be a decay curve of some kind.
We'll look more closely at this data as we go along.

The second project is a simple form of [computational stylometry](glossary.html#computational-stylometry).
Different writers have different styles;
can a computer detect those differences,
and if so,
can it determine who the likely author of a text actually was?
Computational stylometry has been used to explore
which parts of Shakespeare's plays might have been written by other people,
which presidential tweets were composed by other people,
and who wrote incriminating emails in several high-profile legal cases.

The authors of our books are listed below.
Three of them were purportedly written by Jane Austen;
we will see if the similarity measures we develop show that.

| Author                      | Book                            |
