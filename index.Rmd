## Why isn't all of this normal already? {#overview-against}

Nobody argues that research should be irreproducible or unsustainable,
but "not against it" and actively supporting it are very different things.
Academia doesn't yet know how to reward people for writing useful software,
so while you may be thanked,
the extra effort you put in may not translate into job security or decent pay.

And some people still argue against openness,
Being open is a big step toward a (non-academic) career path,
which is where approximately 80% of PhDs go,
and for those staying in academia,
open work is cited more often than closed (FIXME: citation).
However,
some people still worry that if they make their data and code generally available,
someone else will use it and publish a result they have come up with themselves.
This is almost unheard of in practice,
but that doesn't stop people using it as a boogeyman.

Other people are afraid of looking foolish or incompetent by sharing code that might contain bugs.
This isn't just [impostor syndrome](glossary.html#impostor-syndrome):
members of marginalized groups are frequently judged more harshly than others (FIXME: CITE).

## Acknowledgments {#overview-ack}
