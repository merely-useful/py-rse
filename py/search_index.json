(2019). 1.1 Why isn’t all of this normal already? Nobody argues that research should be irreproducible or unsustainable, but “not against it” and actively supporting it are very different things. Academia doesn’t yet know how to reward people for writing useful software, so while you may be thanked, the extra effort you put in may not translate into job security or decent pay. And some people still argue against openness, Being open is a big step toward a (non-academic) career path, which is where approximately 80% of PhDs go, and for those staying in academia, open work is cited more often than closed (FIXME: citation). However, some people still worry that if they make their data and code generally available, someone else will use it and publish a result they have come up with themselves. This is almost unheard of in practice, but that doesn’t stop people using it as a boogeyman. Other people are afraid of looking foolish or incompetent by sharing code that might contain bugs. This isn’t just impostor syndrome: members of marginalized groups are frequently judged more harshly than others (FIXME: citation). 1.2 Acknowledgments This book owes its existence to the hundreds of researchers we met through Software Carpentry and Data Carpentry.

The advanced course can then assume that learners have hands-on experience with these topics but nothing more. 2.1 Personas 2.1.1 Anya Anya is a professor of neuropsychology who is responsible for teaching her department’s introduction to statistics to 1100 first-year students every year. (Students complain that the Stats department’s introductory course is too theoretical and requires more programming knowledge than they have.) When she finds time for it, her research focuses on color perception in infants. Over the past nine years, Anya has designed and run a dozen experiments on 50-100 infant subjects each and analyzed the results using SPSS and more recently R (which she taught herself during a sabbatical). She has never taken a programming course, and suffers from impostor syndrome when talking to colleagues who are using things like GitHub and R Markdown. Anya would like to figure out how to use R to teach her intro stats course, which currently uses a mixture of Excel and SPSS. She would like to learn more about time series analysis to support her research, and about tools like Git and R Markdown. This guide has modular lessons and exercises that she can adapt to use in her course, and suggestions for how to make learning interactive with a large class size. She also finds helpful instructions for applying time series analysis to data using R. 2.1.2 Exton Exton taught business at a community college before joining a friend’s startup, and now does community management for a company that builds healthcare software. He still teaches Marketing 101 every year to help people with backgrounds like his. Exton uses Excel to keep track of who is registered for webinars, workshops, and training sessions. Some of these spreadsheets are created from CSV files produced by a web-scraping script a summer intern wrote for him a couple of years ago. Exton doesn’t think of himself as a programmer, but spends hours creating complicated lookup tables in multi-sheet spreadsheets to help him figure out how many webinar attendees turn into community contributors, who answers forum posts most frequently, and so on. Exton knows there are better ways to do what he’s doing, but feels overwhelmed by the flood of blog posts, tweets, and “helpful” recommendations he receives from members of the company’s engineering team. He wants someone to tell him where he should start and how long it will take whatever he learns to pay off. Exton finds ‘Merely Useful’ after some Googling, and sees an example of data analysis with spreadsheet data that looks really similar to what he’s trying to do. He carefully works through that particular example, then goes back and works through some of the earlier material in the book. He can tell that it won’t take long to get this to work with his data. 2.1.3 Irwin Irwin, 18, is five months into an undergraduate degree in urban planning. He’s read lots of gushing articles in Wired about data science, and was excited by the prospect of learning how to do it, but dropped his CS 101 course after six weeks because nothing made sense. (His university’s computer science department uses Haskell as an introductory programming language…) He is doing better in Anya’s course (which he is taking as an elective) but still spends most of his time copying, pasting, and swearing. Irwin did well in his high school math classes, and built himself a home page with HTML and CSS in a weekend workshop in grade 11. He knows how to do simple calculations in Excel, has accounts on nine different social media sites, and attends all of his morning classes online. Anya mentions this guide in one of her classes, and Irwin downloads the PDF to read on the bus. He loves the examples that use urban data, and right away he has tons of ideas about where to get more cool data to analyze. His urban data science blog is already taking shape in his head. 2.1.4 Camilla Camilla recently started a job as an assistant professor. Her department (Medieval Studies) is trying to develop a digital humanities data-science-heavy undergraduate program, and the undergraduate chair thinks that Camilla has the most programming experience in the department and has asked her to develop an introduction to programming course for humanities students. Camilla has dabbled in natural language processing and has learned Python over the course of her previous work, but she has no experience teaching progamming and she’s not sure what the best way is to teach beginners. She doesn’t want to start from scratch to create a course out of nothing. She also isn’t sure which programming language the new program should focus on. She finds ‘Merely Useful’ and feels relieved: she can pretty much use the book as-is for her course. She looks up the examples of text and image analysis and compares how both R and Python approach those kinds of data to help her make a decision about which language to teach. 2.1.5 Jordan Jordan is a third-year undergraduate student in ecology. Two months ago she started working part-time for a professor in her department, and she’s beginning to collect and analyze data from her own experiments with fruit flies. Her professor has asked her to learn R to do her analysis and suggested that she sign up for the introduction to quantitative data analysis in R course that the ecology department offers. The course is just starting, and it uses ‘Merely Useful’ as the textbook. Jordan can’t wait to apply her new programming knowledge to her data, so she starts reading ahead and trying to use her own data in some of the book’s examples. As she works through examples, she realizes that she’ll need to change a few things about how she records her data in spreadsheets so that it will be easier to analyze in R. 2.2 Getting started What are the different ways I can interact with software? console scripts How can I find and view help?

What are some basic actions I can do with Python? How do I get help? As stated in the intro, our overall goal is to work with people, programs and data. In this section, we will focus on programs and data as we learn how to run Python code and how data is stored and accessed on a computer. 4.2 Introduction to Spyder Starting with programs - over the entirety of this book, we’ll be writing programs (or, in verb form, programming) in order to accomplish our goals of working with data on the computer. Programming is one way to make a computer do something for us. Instead of clicking, we’ll mostly be typing; instead of doing what someone else has pre-defined, we’ll have a lot of flexibility to do what we want. Just like using a web browser to access websites, and a program like Word to write documents, it’s helpful to have a program on your computer that is designed to make it easy to write and run code. This kind of program is called an “IDE” or Integrated Development Environment. The one we’ll be using in this book for writing Python code is called Spyder. Spyder (like many IDEs) opens up and has many panes, that each have a different purpose (Figure 4.2. Figure 4.1: Spyder We’ll take it slowly and introduce the purpose of each pane one-by-one. To start with, we’ll focus on the left and lower-right panes, as that’s where the bulk of our coding will happen. 4.3 Running Code in the Console Now that we have our code-writing-and-running environment open, it’s time to actually run some code. In the bottom right pane, you can see something called the “console”. This is a program that is constantly ready and waiting to take in code and run it; as a Python console, the language it expects to see is Python. Here’s an example you can type or copy in: print(&quot;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.&quot;) ## It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. As you might guess from the name, the Python print() function takes in text (indicated by the quotes) and then prints the text back out to the console. Python has many built-in functions, that allow you to do different things: len(&quot;Sydney Carton&quot;) ## 13 sorted([&quot;Samuel&quot;, &quot;Nathaniel&quot;, &quot;Augustus&quot;, &quot;Tracy&quot;]) ## [&#39;Augustus&#39;, &#39;Nathaniel&#39;, &#39;Samuel&#39;, &#39;Tracy&#39;] min([4, 2/3, -3, 6.25]) ## -3 pow(5,3) ## 125 Part of learning to program is learning some of the core Python functions and what they do; in upcoming chapters, we’ll focus on functions that allow you to read in and manipulate data. At some point it may be helpful to write your own functions, which we’ll also cover in another chapter. 4.4 Running Code via Scripts Can you imagine a situation where continuing to type code into the console could become tedious or challenging? Here are some examples: Wanting to run the same piece of code many times (you can use the up-arrow to see previous commands - try it! - but if you run many commands, your history will quickly become more cluttered. Wanting to organize long sections of code in a meaningful way and work on subsections separately. Wanting to save the code as a text file that can be stored on the computer’s hard drive and shared with collaborators. So we’re motivated to find a way to write and run code where we’re keeping a record as we go along, and it is easy to run code again, in chunks. The answer to these challenges is to move to the left pane of the Spyder IDE. This is a script: a text file with Python code. Try copying in some of the commands we’ve already run (Figure 4.2): print(&quot;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.&quot;) ## It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. sorted([&quot;Samuel&quot;, &quot;Nathaniel&quot;, &quot;Augustus&quot;, &quot;Tracy&quot;]) ## [&#39;Augustus&#39;, &#39;Nathaniel&#39;, &#39;Samuel&#39;, &#39;Tracy&#39;] Figure 4.2: A Short Script Now these commands are written in the script, but nothing has happened yet. In order to run the commands from the script (just like we did in the console), we’ll have to use various run commands. You can see these under the “Run” menu; but typically you’ll want to learn at least one or two keyboard shortcuts so it becomes quick and easy to run code that’s written in a script. Try “running” the lines in your script. You should see their output in the console on the bottom right. 4.4.1 Organizing Sections with Code Cells When writing code it is helpful to have granular control over what code is executed when and we often don’t want to run the entire script. A helpful feature of scripts are code cells, which are separated by #%%. If we would rewrite the code above so that each line is in a different code cell, it would look like this. #%% print(&quot;It was the best of times, it was the worst of times.&quot;) #%% ## It was the best of times, it was the worst of times. sorted([&quot;Samuel&quot;, &quot;Nathaniel&quot;, &quot;Augustus&quot;, &quot;Tracy&quot;]) ## [&#39;Augustus&#39;, &#39;Nathaniel&#39;, &#39;Samuel&#39;, &#39;Tracy&#39;] To run a code cell, we can press Ctrl+Enter. To run a code cell and advance to the next, we can press Shift+Enter. Code cells facilitate developing and troubleshooting sections of the code one at a time. A common scenario where this is useful in data science is when you read in data from a file in one code cell and start working and iterating on the analysis part in the next code cell without the need to reread the data every time you want to test your new analysis. We will talk more about code cell workflows later. Sometimes, when you want to experiment or check something, it can make sense to write and run Python code in the console. However, most of the time, you’ll want to write and run your code from a script. Using scripts has the benefit of saving your work, commonly as a text file with the .py extension, while also being able to run the code just like in the console. The script then has the added benefit of being easy to share and runnable outside of the IDE. We have now told the computer what to do by using Python code, and we have run that code in two different ways within our “workbench” - the Spyder IDE. Let’s see what else we can use in this environment to help us. 4.5 Variables, Objects, Methods Besides running functions that do something (as above), we’ll also want to use Python to keep track of information that we’re using throughout our analysis. We save that information by giving it a name (called a variable), using the name, an equals sign (=) and then the information to save. For example: message = &quot;It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done&quot; name_length = len(&quot;Sydney Carton&quot;) The actual values being referenced by the variable (to the right of the equals sign) are stored by the programming language as an object. There are different types of objects based on the type of information you’re using. On the top right pane, there’s a tab that says “Variable Explorer”. If you click on that, you’ll see the variables and corresponding objects you just created, with some additional information about the Type - str (string of letters), int (integer), float (a “floating point” number, or decimal) and more. Objects can also be referenced later in functions by using their variable name: print(&quot;My message:&quot;, message) ## My message: It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done print(&quot;Letters in name:&quot;, name_length) ## Letters in name: 13 Most types have special functions specific to that type, called [methods][method]. Methods look like functions (name()), but instead of putting the input information inside the parentheses (as we did with the functions above), methods are tacked onto the end of a variable, assuming that the “input” information the method uses is coming from that variable. For example, what happens if we use the following string methods: message.upper() ## &#39;IT IS A FAR, FAR BETTER THING THAT I DO, THAN I HAVE EVER DONE&#39; message.split() ## [&#39;It&#39;, &#39;is&#39;, &#39;a&#39;, &#39;far,&#39;, &#39;far&#39;, &#39;better&#39;, &#39;thing&#39;, &#39;that&#39;, &#39;I&#39;, &#39;do,&#39;, &#39;than&#39;, &#39;I&#39;, &#39;have&#39;, &#39;ever&#39;, &#39;done&#39;] Here, it’s assumed that the contents of the message variable are the information used by the upper() and split() string methods. Note how an upper() method makes sense for strings, but wouldn’t make sense for a numeric object. 4.6 Getting Help in Spyder That top-right pane can give us additional information; one of the other tabs says “Help”. The main way to look up a particular function or type is to type it into the Console and then type the Help shortcut (which is CTRL-I). So, if you wanted to look up information about the len() function, we used above, you can type the following into the console and then use the help shortcut: len Typing the full name of the function (without pressing ENTER) with the Help tab selected will also trigger the help page about that function: len() You can see what methods are available for an object by typing the variable name into the console or script pane and then pressing TAB. This will bring up a list of possible methods to use. 4.7 Getting Help Online Sometimes, however, your questions won’t fit well within the built-in help pages, available through Spyder. This often happens when you need to do something completely new and you don’t know where to start. In that scenario, there are multiple internet resources that are helpful: blogs question pages on Stack Overflow Twitter Sometimes these resources can be overwhelming and confusing. Some things to look for on a Stack Overflow answer: Is the question clearly stated and is there example code? If you’re debugging, does the example code look like yours? Answers have upvotes and downvotes. Is there one clear answer that has a lot of upvotes in response to a question? How complex is the answer? While some questions will necessarily have a complicated answer, for many common programming tasks, there should be a few-line solution to the question. Do you recognize any terms in the solution? If you don’t, are there other terms that you could search on? Conventions One tool in using help pages (and in reading the rest of the book) will be understanding the conventions that writers use when describing many of the terms introduced in this chapter. For example name() indicates that something is a function, where: type.name() would indicate something is a method. Both have parentheses to indicate that they are actions with (potentially) inputs and outputs. Some other conventions used in this book are: * folder_name/ for a folder * variable_name for variables * column_name for columns 4.8 Exercises Run each of the functions above. Can you explain what each function expects as input, and what kind of output it produces? What would be the pros and cons of using the console versus a script in each situation? Writing a data analysis with multiple steps. Opening a new data set and exploring its dimensions. Checking the value of a variable. You’ve saved a string of interesting data to a variable. sentence = &quot;One fish, two fish, red fish, blue fish.&quot; How can you count the occurrences of the letter “f”? After googling “how to read csv file python”, these two answers pop up: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41585078/how-do-i-read-and-write-csv-files-with-python/41585079 https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5788521/reading-a-csv-file-using-python What is useful about each page? Do you understand all of the code in the second page? There are many options given in the first Stack Overflow page. Which one seems like a good place to start? Both pages include python libraries (extra tools), which are added to the code using import. Based on this information, looking at the options shown in these two pages, what are two libraries that can be used to read in csv files? Try reading a csv file: import pandas data = pandas.read_csv(&quot;measurements.csv&quot;) Which pane in Spyder will show our new data object? What happens when you click on it? 4.9 Key Points Spyder is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing Python code. You can run Python via a script or console; for most scenarios, we write and execute code from a script. IDEs like Spyder have shortcuts and help pages to facilitate writing code. Actions in Python are performed by functions and methods. Information in Python is stored as objects that are labeled with variables. "],

How can I make my programs tell me that something has gone wrong? How can I ask for help online? What are packages and how do I install them? 5.2 Functions Functions are like recipes. You give a few ingredients as input to a function, and it will generate an output based on these ingredients. Just as when following a recipe, both the ingredients and the instructions will influence the final result. In Python, the inputs to a function are not called ingredients, but rather arguments, and the output is referred to as the return value of the function. A function does not technically need to return a value, but often does so. Functions facilitate reusing chunks of code in a way that is more readable and reproducible than cutting and pasting several lines of code. E.g. if our data analysis code is broken down into functions, we could readily use it with many different data sets by changing the input data path, but leaving the rest of the code the same. Well chosen function names also clarifies the flow of analysis. For example, imagine that you open a file with the following lines of code within it. images = read_in_images(file_paths) gray_images = convert_to_grayscale(images) brightest_image = find_brightest_image(gray_images) Just by looking at the function names, it is clear what this code is intended for and its main flow of operations is immediately visible. Inside each of these functions there might be 10-20 lines of code, so if we would not have modularized the code into separate functions with well chosen names, it would take longer to understand its overall purpose since there would be 30-60 lines of code to read instead of just three. 5.2.1 Creating functions There are many useful functions already built into Python, and the ability to create your own allows you to string together any sequence of operations in ways that are tailored to your workflow. The def keyword lets us define a function with a name of our choice and an arbitrary number of input parameters. def sum_two_numbers(num1, num2): return num1 + num2 This function accepts two input parameters, num1 and num2, and returns their sum. Just as with variable names, function names are preferably written in snake_case (see the style guide for details), and avoid existing Python keywords and built-in names (a list of these is available here, but instead of memorizing that list you can type the desired name into the Python interpreter to find out if it already exists). To execute the operations listed in the function, we can call the function and pass the two numbers we want to add as the arguments to the function. sum_two_numbers(2, 5) ## 7 The returned value can be assigned to a variable: number_sum = sum_two_numbers(2, 5) number_sum ## 7 A more versatile function could add any amount of numbers together and return their sum: def sum_all_numbers(list_of_numbers): number_sum = 0 for number in list_of_numbers: number_sum += number return number_sum sum_all_numbers([1, 2, 3,]) ## 6 A function can also return multiple outputs, e.g. we can return the number of elements in addition to their sum: def sum_and_len_all_numbers(list_of_numbers): number_sum = 0 number_len = 0 for number in list_of_numbers: number_sum += number number_len += 1 return number_sum, number_len To capture the output, we can either assign to a single name, a tuple, or assign both at the same time to different variables. sum_and_len_of_numbers = sum_and_len_all_numbers([1, 2, 3]) sum_and_len_of_numbers ## (6, 3) sum_of_numbers, len_of_numbers = sum_and_len_all_numbers([1, 2, 3]) sum_of_numbers ## 6 len_of_numbers ## 3 Note that when we defined the function sum_two_numbers(), we referred to num1 and num2 as parameters, while we refer to the numbers we pass to the function call (2 and 5 above) as arguments. Although this might sound confusing at first, it is a standard followed by many programming languages so it is useful to get accustomed to this terminology. 5.2.1.1 Function composition Combining functions is referred to as function composition. This practice allows us to write functions that perform one specific task and then combine them for more complicated tasks, which makes code more readable and easier to debug. By composing a function from the built-in len() and sum() functions, we can create a more succinct and easier to read version of our previous function sum_and_len_all_numbers(). def sum_and_len(list_of_numbers): return sum(list_of_numbers), len(list_of_numbers) 5.2.1.2 Positional and keyword arguments Up until now, our function calls have included just enough arguments to assign one to each of the function parameters. The assignment has been based on the position of the arguments in the function call and therefore these are called positional arguments. We could be more explicit and include the parameter name in the assignment. sum_two_numbers(num1=2, num2=5) ## 7 The arguments are now referred to as keyword arguments and has the advantage that they can be specified in any order. sum_two_numbers(num2=5, num1=2) ## 7 5.2.1.3 Defining default values Above, we have specified a value for every argument in each function call. This is manageable when functions have few parameters, but it can get tedious for functions with many parameters. Defining default values for select parameters can facilitate working with complex functions by reducing the number of arguments that need to be defined when calling the function and guide users to good default choices for the parameters without requiring in-depth knowledge of each parameter. As an example, we can modify sum_two_numbers() to optionally return the two input arguments. def sum_two_numbers(num1, num2, return_input=False): if return_input: return num1, num2, num1 + num2 else: return num1 + num2 By default the function will work just as previously. sum_two_numbers(2, 5) ## 7 But we now also have the option to return the input numbers. sum_two_numbers(2, 5, return_input=True) ## (2, 5, 7) Since the arguments are given in the same order as in the function definition, we could have left out the return_input= part and just written True in the third position. 5.2.1.4 Function documentation Functions might appear self-explanatory when they are being written, but it is essential that there is proper documentation describing what the function does and what types of arguments should be in the input. This helps other people who are reading your code and also your future self that will be reusing these functions. In Python, a function is documented in its docstring, which is a multiline Python string immediately following the function definition. It is surrounded by triple quotes (either single or double) and can look like this. def sum_two_numbers(num1, num2): &#39;&#39;&#39; Add two numbers Parameters ---------- num1: int, float The first number to be added. num2: int, float The second number to be added. Returns ------- int, float Sum of the two numbers. &#39;&#39;&#39; return num1 + num2 The above docstring convention is referred to as the numpy docstring format. There are other conventions, but here we recommended using the numpy docstring format since it is easy to read for complex functions with many arguments and used by many integral data science Python packages. It is described in great detail in the numpy and pandas documentation. Docstrings constitute the text that show up in the function help message, so it is important that these are well-written and helpful for the reader. help(sum_two_numbers) ## Help on function sum_two_numbers in module __main__: ## ## sum_two_numbers(num1, num2) ## Add two numbers ## ## Parameters ## ---------- ## num1: int, float ## The first number to be added. ## num2: int, float ## The second number to be added. ## ## Returns ## ------- ## int, float ## Sum of the two numbers. This is the same text that is displayed in the Spyder help pane, where it is rendered as markdown for rich display with typefaces, headings, etc. Rich rendering of the docstring in Spyder Spyder includes a convenient function to automatically generate docstring templates. Once you have written the function signature and typed out the first triple quote for the docstring, there will be a small pop-up window that reads “Generate docstring”. Click it or press enter and a numpy docstring template will be created based on the parameters in the function signature. 5.3 How to make programs indicate that something has gone wrong? When performing programmatic data analysis, we need to both ensure that our code runs correctly and that it carries out the intended tasks. The Python interpreter will help us with the first part; if a part of the code is not valid, an error will be raised with a message that helps us trace back what part of the code is not correct. 5.3.1 Ducktyping - relying on Python to detect unexpected behavior In our function sum_two_numbers(), we could explicitly check that the input arguments are numerical. However, explicitly checking the type of each input parameter quickly becomes tedious and can make functions less readable, especially as they grow more complex. An alternative approach is to try to perform the intended operations on the input parameters and rely on that Python will raise an error if they are of the wrong type. sum_two_numbers(5, &#39;six&#39;) ## Error in py_call_impl(callable, dots$args, dots$keywords): TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: &#39;int&#39; and &#39;str&#39; ## ## Detailed traceback: ## File &quot;&lt;string&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt; ## File &quot;&lt;string&gt;&quot;, line 18, in sum_two_numbers The raised error contains a helpful message that alerts us to what went wrong; string objects cannot be added to int objects in Python. If the input variables behave correctly then they probably are of the correct types and no explicit checking is needed. This approach is often referred to as “ducktyping” because it makes assumptions on the type of variable based on its behavior, just like the saying If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck. 5.3.2 Assertions - explicitly checking for unexpected behavior Ducktyping is useful to catch anything that raises an error in Python, but sometimes we might want to stop the code execution for reasons other than a technical Python error. Examples of this include when you have performed a specific operation that you know should give output of a certain shape and to check if a variable is within an allowed range. The assert statement allows us to check if a condition is True and stop code execution if it is not. assert 1 == 0 ## Error in py_call_impl(callable, dots$args, dots$keywords): AssertionError: ## ## Detailed traceback: ## File &quot;&lt;string&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt; print(&#39;This is only printed if the assertion above is &quot;True&quot;&#39;) ## This is only printed if the assertion above is &quot;True&quot; Since the condition above is False, an AssertionError is raised and code execution halts. If the assertion is True, there is no output and the next line of code is executed (if there is one). assert 0 == 0 print(&#39;This is only printed if the assertion above is &quot;True&quot;&#39;) ## This is only printed if the assertion above is &quot;True&quot; As mentioned above, this is useful if we know that a variable should look a certain way, since we can assert if this is the case and guard ourselves from errors that originate early in the pipeline but could give rise to more cryptic errors that are difficult to troubleshoot later in the pipeline. It is often helpful to add a clarifying message to the assertion statement, especially as assertions become more complex. x = 1 assert x == 0, &#39;x is not 0&#39; ## Error in py_call_impl(callable, dots$args, dots$keywords): AssertionError: x is not 0 ## ## Detailed traceback: ## File &quot;&lt;string&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt; Note that similar functionality can be achieved by explicitly raising an error within a try and except block, or within a conditional statement using if, elif, and else, but assert is a simple and readable way of allowing for manual error checking. 5.4 Packages 5.4.1 Installing Python There are several ways of installing Python on your system. One of the most robust and cross-platform compatible is to install the Anaconda Python distribution, which is available for Linux, macOS and Windows. Choose to download the Python 3 installer unless you need to work with Python 2 for a specific reason. 5.4.2 Using Python When the Anaconda installation has finished, Python is accessible by running python in a terminal (on Windows, use the Anaconda Prompt). Anaconda also includes graphical interfaces for interacting with Python, which can be invoked by running spyder or jupyter-lab from the command line, these are covered more in detail elsewhere in this book. 5.4.3 What is a package? A package is essentially a few Python scripts in a specific directory structure coupled with installation instructions for the computer. Python packages can come from various sources. Many that you will use are part of the standard distribution, but packages can be created by anyone and there are thousands of that can be downloaded and installed from online repositories. Note that you will sometimes hear packages referred to as “modules”. The two words are often used interchangeably. Technically, a package is a folder that contains modules (scripts), which in turn contains functions (code). Certain functionality that is considered essential for the Python programming language is available wherever Python is installed. This is the Python Standard Library, which is [maintained by the core language team][pep13]. Anything you see within the [Python documentation pages][py-docs] is part of the standard library. Other highly useful, but often more domain specific functionality can be accessed separately in the form of Python packages from third party developers. People around the world have created packages for Python and made them freely available for others to use resulting in one of the richest package ecosystems for any programming language, with packages for web design, prose writing, game development, and data science (to name just a few). Since there are so many packages available, it is not feasible to include all of them with the default Python installation (it would be as if your new phone came with every single app from the app/playstore preinstalled). Instead, Python packages can be downloaded from central repositories online and installed as needed. The two main repositories are the Python Package Index (PyPi) and the Anaconda package repository. Instead of navigating to these sites with a web browser, downloading the desired packages and installing them manually, there are so called package managers that automate these processes. The package manager for PyPi is called pip and the package manager for Anaconda is called conda. To install a package either of these can be used, below is an example of what to type on the command line to install the numerical python package numpy. conda install numpy pip install numpy Uninstalling a package is equally simple conda remove numpy pip uninstall numpy Since we have downloaded the Anaconda Python distribution, we will predominantly be using the conda package manager. Installing packages with both interchangeably works, but it is recommended to stick to one as much as possible. The Anaconda team has already bundled many commonly used packages together with their Python installer, including most of the common data science packages, such as numpy and pandas. Now that you know how to access many of the world’s best data science packages right from your terminal, let’s see how we can use them! Pro tip: Some packages are not available in the default Anaconda repositories. User contributed packaged are available in Anaconda “channels”, use anaconda search -t conda &lt;package name&gt;, to find a channel with the desired package. To install this package, use conda install -c &lt;channel name&gt; &lt;package name&gt;. The conda forge channel channel has many of the packages not in the default repositories. 5.4.4 Importing packages Many of the functions that we use regularly, such as print() and len() are part of Python’s Built-in functions. These are the functions that are always avaliable, but often our programs will need tools beyond these built-ins. Importing in this sense means that you are asking your program to “opt-in” to using that package’s content. The syntax for importing content is the same for stardand library packages, third party packages, and local custom files. The lack of difference in syntax means that code can become confusing if you aren’t extremely conversant in many of the packages. This is where good documentation comes in. Import statements are generally found at the beginning of script or notebook files. Note that many of these examples will talk about importing functions, but there are several other types of content that can be imported from a package. There are two main ways of importing content: import &lt;package_name&gt;: Import the entire package, giving you access to the package content by way of the package’s name. E.g. &lt;package_name&gt;.&lt;function_name&gt;(). from &lt;package_name&gt; import &lt;function_name&gt;: Import the entire package, but only define variables for the functions you list explicitly. This gives you access to the imported content without having to specify the package name. E.g. function_name(). Each of these methods has a way of renaming the package or content name to shorten it or in case there are multiple with the same name and you need to avoid namespace clashes. This is done using the as keyword, which is described in detail later in this chapter. Any installed package can be accessed by typing import &lt;package_name&gt; in Python, e.g. import numpy After importing a Python package, we can access any of its functions, by first writing the followed by a period and then the function name, e.g. numpy.mean([1, 2, 3]) ## 2.0 You can think of this as navigating to the numpy menu in a GUI software, and then clicking the function you want. You don’t need to recall every function name by hard, pressing the TAB key after the period, will bring up all available function and intelligently filter them as you type out more letters, try it! When you start getting familiar with typing function names, you will notice that this is often faster than looking for functions in menus. It is common to give packages shorter nicknames, which are faster to type. This is not necessary, but can save work in long files and make code less verbose so that it is easier to read: import numpy as np np.mean([1, 2, 3]) ## 2.0 Using this syntax makes the variable numpy not defined in the current namespace. We could also import the mean function directly. Be careful, importing functions this way may cause name clashing and make your code harder to read because it isn’t clear where that function came from. from numpy import mean mean([1, 2, 3]) ## 2.0 And even give it a nickname. from numpy import mean as mn mn([1, 2, 3]) ## 2.0 Which of these you use is up to you, but it is common to follow the conventions established by the library’s authors, which for numpy is import numpy as np and use functions via np.&lt;function_name&gt;. Following community conventions means that your code will align with common documentation resources and will be understandable to other users of that tool. One thing to avoid is to import everything from a package, e.g. from numpy import *. If this is done with every package, it is almost guaranteed that the same function name will be available from more than one package and it will be difficult to keep track of it if you are using the mean function from numpy or from another package that you also imported everything from. Subpackages and their functions can be imported via the dot syntax. from numpy.fft import fftfreq Packages and subpackages might sound complicated to keep apart. It can be helpful to understand that they are folders and files in specific directory structure. Considering only the numpy packages we have mentioned so far, the directory structure would look like this. numpy-folder/ script-with-the-mean-definition.py fft-folder/ script-with-the-fftfreq-definition.py 5.4.5 Installing packages After Anaconda has been installed on your system, you can use the command line conda package manager or the GUI-driven anaconda-navigator to install Python packages. For comprehensive instructions on both of these, refer to the official documentation. Brief step-by-step instructions to get up and running with conda follow. To install a new Python package from the Anaconda repositories, simply run conda install &lt;package name&gt; in a terminal. You can also use the pip package manager, but it will be easier to keep track of packages by sticking to one installation method. Some packages are not available in the default Anaconda repositories. User contributed packaged are available in Anaconda “channels”, use anaconda search -t conda &lt;package name&gt;, to find a channel with the desired package. To install this package, use conda install -c &lt;channel name&gt; &lt;package name&gt;. The conda forge channel channel has many of the packages not in the default repositories. 5.5 How to get help online When reading the built-in Python help is not sufficient, there are several online resources that can helpful. One of the most commonly used resources for data science is the Stack Exchange network which offer Q&amp;A sites both for programming related topics via Stack Overflow, as well as statistics and machine learning via Cross Validated. If nothing relevant can be found after searching the many existing question and answers on these sites, it is appropriate to ask a new question! Stack Overflow has detailed instruction on how to create a minimal reproducible example when asking a question to increase the chances that the question receives a specific and helpful answer. The key principles listed on the website recommends that an answer follows these guidelines: Minimal – Use as little code as possible that still produces the same problem Complete – Provide all parts someone else needs to reproduce your problem in the question itself Reproducible – Test the code you’re about to provide to make sure it reproduces the problem An additional benefit of reducing the problem into this format is that you might discover the error in the process! This process helps narrowing down exactly which region of the code is failing and the act of explaining the problem often reveals a solution before any replies have come in (commonly referred to as rubber duck debugging. 5.6 Key Points Functions allow partitioning of code into segments that perform specific tasks. They make code easier to write, read, troubleshoot, and reuse. Functions can have default values for certain input parameters, which allows these parameters not to be explicitly set every time a function is called. Ducktyping relies on the Python interpreter to raise meaningful errors when an illegal operation tries to execute. Assert statements can be used to explicitly check the truth value of a condition and halt code execution if needed. When asking for help online, it is critical to include a minimal reproducible example so that the question can receive suitable replies. Packages makes it easy to reuse and share code in an organized and automated manner. These can be installed with package managers. 5.7 Exercises Write a function that returns the mean of exactly two numbers. Start with the code we used to create the function sum_two_numbers() above. Write a function that returns the mean of any amount of numbers. Start with the code we used to create the function sum_and_len_all_numbers() above. Write a function that takes a string as its input and returns a tuple with the first and last character of the string. Write a function that takes a string as its input and can return any single character. Which character is returned should be determined by an integer passed to a parameter called character_index which has the default value of 0. Expand on the previous function by including an assert statement that checks if the integer given to the character_index parameter is within the length of the string. Describe the pros and cons of the ducktyping approach in 4a and the explicit assert approach in 4b. "],

A key part of any project is communicating what you have learned. You’ve already seen how to create documents to communicate your work with Jupyter notebooks, and how to host whole projects on GitHub. This chapter is about sharing your work through a webpage on the internet. Some advantages of sharing your work on a webpage include: It’s easy for your visitors—they just need to click on a link and see your work. They don’t need to know anything about Jupyter Notebooks, HTML, or GitHub. It provides a visually friendly and customizable landing point for people interested in your project. You can easily point them to the GitHub repo if they want more details. It’s easy for you to make updates and those updates are immediately available to any visitors—you don’t have to re-send anyone any files. By the end of this chapter, you’ll be able to take an Jupyter Notebook that lives on your computer and share it with the world through a link to your own webpage. 6.3 What does it take to get a webpage online? To understand what it takes to get a webpage online, it helps to understand roughly what happens when you point your browser at a web address. When you point your browser at an address, for example https://merely-useful.github.io/py-publishing.html, the following things happen: The URL https://merely-useful.github.io points to a location on another computer where the relevant files for this website reside. This computer is known as the website host or server, since it hosts the webpage files on its local storage drives and serves them to us via the internet. The browser requests the file py-publishing.html from the host. The browser reads the contents of py-publishing.html and displays it for you in the browser window. In reverse order this process also describes what you need to do to get your own website online: You need an HTML file that describes what people should see on your page. You need to host the HTML file on a computer on the internet. You need a way to associate a URL with the address of your host. In this chapter, you’ll learn how to get your work online by creating HTML files using Jupyter notebooks (#1 above) and how to host your work in a GitHub repository (#2). The third step will be handled by a GitHub service called GitHub Pages. By following the conventions that GitHub Pages expects, you’ll be able to make a webpage for any of your repositories available at: http://{{your_username}}.github.io/{{repo_name}}. 6.4 How do I get my work on the web? 6.4.1 A starting point FIXME: revisit this later when more content is fleshed out. Maybe there will be a repo we can rely on all learners having that we can start from. In practice you’ll probably start thinking about a website once you’ve already done a lot of work on a project—your project will already have some analysis documented in Jupyter notebooks, be in version control and hosted on GitHub. However, so that we can work with a specific example, you’ll set up a project in this section that is less developed than where your project might be when you start thinking about making a website. At the end of this section, you should have a project folder with an example report in report.Rmd. This project should also be on GitHub at https://github.com/{{your_username}}/sharing-work, where {{your_username}} should be substituted with your GitHub username, e.g. mine is at https://github.com/cwickham/sharing-work. Let’s start by creating a GitHub repository called sharing-work, by following illustrated steps in the GitHub guide. Open JupyterLab and create a new Jupyter Notebook (“File -&gt; New -&gt; Notebook”, or the Python symbol on the launcher page) Rename this file to report.ipynb and pair it with an .Rmd file using Jupytext. The pairing to an .Rmd file is not necessary, but enables a more human-friendly version control workflow. Change the cell type of the first input cell from code to markdown by using the dropdown menu in the toolbar. Create a markdown title by typing # Sharing work in this cell. Create another markdown cell and type “This is a test repo for GitHub pages”. Commit the changes to the report.Rmd file and push your commits to GitHub. As explained in the Jupytext section, you do not need to commit .ipynb files unless GitHub to render the notebook output. This is our starting point. FIXME: Would it be better to get to this point by getting learners to fork a repo, then “New project -&gt; From version control” in RStudio? Except forking isn’t in the plan for the Version Control section. 6.4.2 HTML files HTML is the language of webpages. JupyterLab makes it easy to turn your notebook into an HTML page by clicking “File -&gt; Export Notebook As -&gt; Export Notebook to HTML”. Now you will have a file name report.html the same directory as the notebook files. HTML is a plain text format with markup tags to indicate how web browsers should display the text. If you open this file in a text editor, you will see the contents of the file. If you open it in a web browser, your browser will read, interpret, and display the HTML for you. You may notice the address bar in your browser looks something like: file:///Users/wickhamc/Documents/Projects/sharing-work/report.html Just as https:// is a signal that a file resides on a remote server computer, file:// is a signal that a file lives on your computer locally. In spite of having “web” in their name, web browsers perfectly displays local files as long as they are in a suitable format, such as HTML. However, you couldn’t give this local address to someone else and expect it to work, because they don’t have this file on their computer. The HTML produced by JupyterLab is completely self-contained, the browser needs no additional files to display the page as you see it now. So if you email the file report.html, your recipients could open it their browser and see the same result. However, our goal will be to put this HTML file on the web, so you can share a link to the file instead of the file itself. You’ll start by having this file accessible at the link https://{{your_username}}.github.io/sharing-work/report.html, then learn how to have it displayed with the shorter link https://{{your_username}}.github.io/sharing-work 6.4.3 Setting up your repo to have a web page Our goal is to get the report that is currently living in report.html displayed when a visitor heads to https://{{your_username}}.github.io/sharing-work. For this we can use GitHub Pages, which is available for any GitHub repository. First create a folder named docs and move report.html into this folder, the content of this folder is what will be displayed online. You online repo structure should now look like this (remember that the .ipynb files are not committed and pushed to GitHub, they only exist in your local folder). ├── docs │ └── report.html └── report.Rmd To activate GitHub Pages, navigate to your GitHub Repository in the browser and head to the “Settings” tab. Scroll to the “GitHub Pages” section. Activate GitHub pages, with source set to “master branch /docs folder”. You should see a message that your site is now live at: https://{{your_username}}.github.io/sharing-work Try visiting: https://{{your_username}}.github.io/sharing-work/report.html. You should see your report. Congratulations you have a webpage! 6.4.4 Getting a default page to display when people visit the project site You could send people the link, https://{{your_username}}.github.io/sharing-work/report.html, but it is often nicer to send them the shorter version without the file name: https://{{your_username}}.github.io/sharing-work. You can try this now, but it won’t work—you’ll see a message in your browser like: “404- File not found”. This shorter URL points to a directory as opposed to a file. By default, when a server receives a request for a directory, it looks for a file to display with a default name—usually index.html. In your case there is no file called index.html so there is nothing to display. If you would like the contents of report.html to be displayed as the homepage of your project, rename report.ipynb to index.ipynb. You’ll then need to regenerate the HTML file, commit it, and push your changes. For work that is communicated easily in one page, this would be a good option. Alternatively, you might have a different page as the default page—one that summarizes the project and then links to other more detailed pages. You’ll see how to do this over the next few sections. To get started create a new Jupyter Notebook paired with an .Rmd file. Create a markdown cell with the following content. This is my project... - Read my report - Visit this project on GitHub Rename the file to index.ipynb, export as HTML to docs/, commit index.html, and push your changes. Your repo should now look like: ├── docs │ ├── index.html │ └── report.html ├── report.Rmd └── index.Rmd Now when you visit https://{{your_username}}.github.io/sharing-work you should see: Note that it might take some time for the webpage to refresh automatically and detect the new index file. You can trigger this manually by going to GitHub Pages settings and changes the source branch to something else than docs/ and then back again. 6.4.5 What does it take to get your work on a webpage? To sum up the process above, in its most minimal form, to have a webpage at https://{{your_username}}.github.io/{{repo_name}}, your repo at https://github.com/{{your_username}}/{{repo_name}} needs to: have an index.html file in the docs directory have GitHub Pages activated in repository settings with source set to “master branch /docs folder”. Be aware that everything inside the docs folder is now public, even if your repository is private. You might have noticed this book lives at a GitHub Pages URL without a repo name—there is nothing after the .io in https://merely-useful.github.io. Both GitHub organizations and individuals can make use of this shorter address (merely-useful is an organization rather than a user, so this is an organization site). There are a few differences between what you’ve learnt so far and the process of setting up a user site without a repo name (at https://{{your_username}}.github.io). First, you need to name your repository in a specific way—it must be called {{your_username}}.github.io. Second, user sites don’t use the docs/ folder—you put your HTML files at the top level in the repo. And third, you don’t have to change any settings with user sites—GitHub will recognize the repo name and automatically serve it at https://{{your_username}}.github.io. 6.4.6 Exercise: Customize index.Rmd Edit index.Rmd to have your name as the author. Export index.Rmd to HTML verify your changes in the browser, then commit and push them. Visit https://{{your_username}}.github.io/sharing-work to check the updated site. This is the workflow for making changes to your webpage. Make edits locally, and export the notebook to check them. Then commit and push to make those changes visible on the web. 6.5 How do I link to other pages, files or images? 6.5.1 Linking to other pages To create a link to another page in markdown file you use the syntax: [text to display](url) Once exported to HTML, only text to display will be visible, and clicking on the text will take a viewer to url. For example, to add a link to my GitHub repo I might add the following line to index.Rmd: Visit [my github repo](https://www.github.com/cwickham/sharing-work) Which when exported to HTML renders like: Visit my github repo This is an example of an absolute URL. Just like when you specify file paths on your own computer, URLs can be both absolute and relative. An absolute URL describes a file location starting from and including the domain name. For instance, the absolute URL that points to report.html in my repo is https://cwickham.github.io/sharing-work/report.html. Relative URLs are relative to the current HTML file. So, for instance if you are viewing https://cwickham.github.io/sharing-work/index.html, a relative link to my report.html would be report.html since this file is at the same level as index.html in my website structure. For pages created using this GitHub Pages workflow, your website structure is the same as the file structure in your docs/ folder. To add a link to report.html in index.Rmd I would add a line like: See the [full report](report.html) You should use relative URLs to reference any of your files ( i.e. those in docs/). That way if you ever rename your repository, move it, or use a different hosting platform, your links will all work without changes. You must use absolute links for files that reside elsewhere on the internet. 6.5.2 Exercise: Relative links Imagine your docs/ folder had the following structure └── docs ├── index.Rmd ├── index.html ├── diagrams │ └── workflow.png └── reports ├── jan.Rmd ├── jan.html ├── feb.Rmd └── feb.html Using a relative URL, how would you refer to: jan.html from index.html? feb.html from jan.html? workflow.png from index.html? 6.5.3 Exercise: Add links to index.html Add to index.Rmd: a link to report.html using a relative link, and a link your GitHub repository using an absolute link. 6.5.4 Linking to sections within a page URLs can also refer to places inside the current page, most usually to another section. In Markdown you’ve seen how to create headings using #. For example, an Appendix subsection might be: ## Appendix If we want to link to this section from elsewhere, you prefix the section name with a single # in the URL. For example, if this section is in report.Rmd and you want to link to it elsewhere in report.Rmd, you could use: See more details in the [appendix](#appendix) The URL #appendix is interpreted as the heading with ID appendix in the current page. Jupyter Notebooks creates IDs for all sections (and subsections) automatically, by converting to lower case and replacing spaces with dashes (-). But, you can explicitly set IDs too, by adding the ID with the # inside curly braces after the section heading. For instance you might prefer the shorter appen ID. You need to set it where the heading occurs: ## Appendix {#appen} Then you can link to it using this shorter ID elsewhere: See more details in the [appendix](#appen) You can also use this strategy to link to sections in other pages by including the relative URL first. For instance, to refer to this “Appendix” section from index.html you could include in index.Rmd: Some gory details of the analysis can also be found in the [Appendix of the report](report.html#appen) 6.5.5 Exercise: Add and link to a section in report.Rmd Add a new section to report.Rmd and include a link to it in index.Rmd. You’ll need to export both report.Rmd and index.Rmd, and commit and push the HTML files to check your work. 6.5.6 Including images Most of your images will likely be plots generated by code in the notebook and thus automatically included in the exported HTML. If you want to display other images, you use the same syntax you saw in the Markdown section of the Reproducibility chapter chapter. That is, in your notebook you’ll include the image with something like: ![Image caption here.](path/to/image/file.png) However, the path/to/image/file.png should be a relative URL pointing at an image in your docs/ directory. For example, if you had an image, me.png, inside an images directory inside your docs folder: └── docs ├── index.Rmd ├── index.html ├── report.Rmd ├── report.html └── images └── me.png You could include it in index.html by adding to index.Rmd the line: ![A picture of me](images/me.png) Notice the syntax is very similar to adding a link to me.png: [A picture of me](images/me.png) Including the image displays the image inside at the appropriate place in the current page, linking to the image requires a viewer to click the link to see the image. Your image will be included at full size, but you might find it too large. You can additionally specify some attributes for the image in curly braces immediately following the link. For instance, use the width attribute to set the image width, either in pixels: [A picture of me](images/me.png){width=50} # default unit is px Or as a percentage: [A picture of me](images/me.png){width=50%} 6.5.7 Exercise: Add an image to index.html Include an image in your index.Rmd. (If you need an image to include you could always build your own version of an Octocat, GitHub’s mascot). Don’t forget, you’ll need to commit both your exported index.html and your image. 6.6 Exercise: Add a website to an existing project Add a website to one of your existing project repositories. You’ll need to complete the following steps: Create a docs/ directory in your project. Add an index.Rmd document to the docs/ folder and export it to HTML to produce index.html. Commit these changes to git, and push to GitHub. Activate GitHub Pages in the repository settings with source set to “master branch /docs folder”. Visit the site to check it is working. "],

FIXME: Figure - PhD Comics, A Story Told in File Names http://phdcomics.com/comics.php?f=1323 When working with files on a computer - documents, scripts, anything involving text - it’s common to run into the situation above. There may be information you don’t want in the final version, but you want to be able to refer back to previous versions of the file. You may want to work on a document and then start over if it’s not going well. It is useful to have a record of changes you’ve made and the previous versions of your work just for your own psychological reassurance. Specifically applied to our world of data science projects, here are some examples of when we might want to maintain multiple versions of one file: adding a new dataset to our analysis constantly modifying or updating the same script incorporating comments or feedback from a reader keeping backup copies of important files The multi-file system above is not ideal though! It requires making multiple copies of the same file, even if the changes are isolated to one part of the file. It also isn’t always easy to know which file has the information that you want to retrieve. Luckily, there’s a better solution - using a version control system. A version control system is a specific tool that can be used to track changes in a file or set of files. The version control tool keeps a record of changes made to a file, while still only having one copy of the file on your hard drive. This record of changes consists of snapshots called “revisions” or “commits”. Most of the day-to-day use of version control systems consists of periodically creating these revisions/commits to record the current state of a file or folder, and how it’s changed since the previous revision. Whenever you create a saved revision through a version control system, you have a chance to add a message that provides some information about the file(s) to that point, making it easier to find previous versions of a file. This chapter will focus on a specific version control tool called “git”. Git is a program that can be installed on your computer and we’ll use it to perform all of the functions described above—creating saved revisions with messages, referencing previous versions of files, and duplicating this revision history across multiple computers. There are other version control programs that can be used for the same purposes; CVS, SVN, and Mercurial are three examples. We’ve used git in this chapter because it’s commonly used and is compatible with at least two free, online spaces for hosting version controlled work. We’ll be using a program called GitKraken to make it easier to use git, in the same way that we used the Spyder IDE to help us write Python code. 7.3 Creating a Repository To get started with tracking work, it’s good to think about what scope of information you want to track. Does it make sense to track all of the files of your computer at once? Probably not. It would be better for the version control system to track changes on a per-project basis. In terms of how we have files organized on our computer, that means we want to track changes inside a project folder (and all its sub-folders). The mechanism used by git to track work is called a “repository” (or “repo” for short) and so for each project where we want to track changes, we need to create a version control repository (in our case, a git repository) associated with the parent folder of the project. In the GitKraken interface, there’s a button to do exactly that, over on the left: “Start a local repo”. It’s possible to use this button to associate a repository with a pre-existing folder, but it’s simpler to generate a repository with a new folder in one go, so that’s what we’ll do. Click on the “Start a local repo” button. This should open up a three part window, where the left part has “Init” selected, the middle part has “Local Only” and the right has some options to fill in. Fill in a name for your repository in the “Name:” box. It can be anything you want. If you want, choose where to create this repository/folder by selecting a location on your computer in “Initialize in:” Finally, click on “Create Repository” Figure 7.1: Getting Started Once this process succeeds, a few things should happen. You should see a folder called test on your computer’s desktop and the GitKraken window will suddenly have a lot more panes. Just like with Spyder, we’re going to focus on just a part of the window for now - the right hand pane, and the middle section. Figure 7.2: Important Panes At this point, we’ve created a git repository associated with our project folder. Now if we make any changes in that folder (or a sub-folder!), git will pay attention and be able to track it for us. Let’s see what happens if we do this. 7.4 Tracking Changes As we add and modify files in our project folder, we want to record our changes. This is done by creating “commits” which are like snapshots of the repository at moments in time. By building up a history of many commits, each created for a different phase of the files in the repository, you can see what changes have happened over time. The process of tracking changes in this way has three stages: Create new files or make changes to existing files in the project repository. Choose the files that you want to create a saved version of (called “staging” or “adding”) “Commit” the changes from the previous step, with a descriptive commit message. commit-cycle To see this in action, create a file called README.md in your test repository. You can technically do this through GitKraken, but it would make more sense to create this file in a text editor like Spyder - it should just be a plain text document, saved in the main folder. # Carbon Levels Project ## Meeting time - December 14, 2019 - 18:00 UTC ## Collaborators - Gina - Mark - Jesus ## My notes After creating this file, switch back to GitKraken and look at the right side of the GitKraken interface. You should see a few changes in the right hand pane. If you click on “View Change”, the right pane will change to show you the list of files that git knows has changed. In this case, it should have the new README.md cycle. It’s now time to do the second part of the cycle—adding or staging files to commit. In the GitKraken interface, this can be done by hitting the “stage all changes” button (which will add all the changed files to the list to be committed) or you can click on individual files and then click on the “Stage File” button. Once you’ve done this, the files that are to be added to the commit will be now in the second box of the right pane, the staging area. If you made a mistake and added files you aren’t yet ready to snapshot, you can “unstage” them here. Once you have the list of files you want to stage, write a commit message in the third box. Then click on the commit changes to one file. We’re sent back to our history mode, with the right pane showing us the latest commit. We’ve gone through the change-and-commit cycle one time. Git has saved information about the state of our README.md file in the repository we created in the previous section. Now, if we make additional changes to the README.md file, we’ll be able to create new commits, building up a history of changes. Try making changes to README.md under the “My Notes” section and committing them. Create a separate Python script and commit that as well, to see what it looks like to have multiple files in the repository. The best way to get used to the process of using version control to track changes is to run through it a few times. Some questions to think about as you practice making commits: How often should you create new commits after making changes? It’s best to create commits fairly frequently, so that you have a good snapshot of your progress. If changes need to take effect at the same time on a group of files, you should commit them together; if changes are unrelated, it’s a good idea to separate them into their own commits. What makes a good version control commit message? A good commit message is succinct but meaningful. While many developers can easily slip into commit messages like “@)#(&amp;#@)(!”, it’s worth the extra few seconds to type something meangingful, especially for our next task: examining previous versions of files. 7.5 Examining Previous Versions We want to keep track of previous versions of a file because sometimes, it’s important to go back and either access the previous version in total, or just see the differences between where we started and where we are now. We’ve used Git to create a list of commits that record versions of a file; now we want to use that history to look back at previous versions of files and compare them with our current version. Another way to think about this is that instead of just going around the change-and-commit cycle in one direction, we want to be able to reverse direction and look at the past. revert-image In order to compare versions of files, we first need to find the versions we want to compare, from somewhere in our repository’s log or history. This is why our commit messages were important! Once you find the commit (or commits) that have the versions you want to reference, it’s relatively simple to compare them or revert a file back to its previous version. If you haven’t already, make a few more changes to the “My notes” section of the README.md file and commit them, and do this enough times to have 3-4 commits in your central history window. The history of commits is in the center pane of the GitKraken window. Choose one of the commits you want to examine, and click on it. You’ll see the right hand pane show all the information associated with the commit, including the file(s) modified in that commit. (If you want to see all the files as they were during a particular commit (not just the modified files), select the desired commit and then click the “View all files” checkbox in the middle-right of the right-hand pane.) Click on a file to see the version saved in the commit. The file will open in the center pane (replacing the history) and at the top will be a toggle between “File View” and “Diff View”. “File View” shows the file as it was when the commit was made. If you click on the “Diff View” side, the file will show how it changed since the previous version of the file. Additions are indicated with green highlighting and a plus; deletions with red highlighting and a minus. You can compare in more selective ways by selecting a whole series of commits, from the commit history, clicking on a changed file, and looking at how the file has changed from the most recent commit you selected to the one preceeding the oldest commit you selected. Finally, sometimes you may want to return back to a previous version altogether. To do this, select the commit you want to return to from the commit history. Right click on it and then select “Revert commit”. GitKraken will ask you if you want to commit changes immediately. Clicking “yes” will change the file back to a previous version and simultaneously commit it; clicking “no” will simply change the file back, but if you want to keep it, you have to go through the add and commit process yourself. 7.6 Online Repositories To this point, we’ve used git features to track changes and compare versions of files in our project repository. An additional way to use git to manage our project is to create a duplicate of our project repository online. As we commit changes to the project on our computer, we can periodically update the online copy so that we have a backup. Sending changes from our computer to an online copy is called “pushing” and if we want to get changes from the online copy to our computer, the command is called “pulling.” In what follows, we’ll set up a blank online repository and push and pull changes to and from it. remote-image We’ll be using Github as the home for the online copy of the project repository. To start, create an empty repository on Github by going to the main Github page and clicking on the green “New” button on the left. You must be logged in for this to work! You’ll be taken to a screen that gives you some options about your new repository - because we want it to be blank, leave all the options as they are. The only piece you need to fill in is a name for the repository. This doesn’t have to be the same as the folder on your computer, but for clarity, it should be clear that they’re related. After you click on the “Create repository” button, you’ll be taken to a page with your new blank repository. The link in your browser should be of the format https://github.com/username/repositoryname Copy this link - we’ll need it in a moment. The next step is to link the project repository on our computer with the (blank) online one. To do this, venture into the left pane of the GitKraken Window, where it says “REMOTE”. Click on the plus that appears there and a window will open for adding a remote (online) repository. You can give it a nickname in the “Name” box and then paste in the link to your repository for both the Pull URL and Push URL. Click “Add Remote.” The nickname for your online repository should now appear on the left. We want to update it with our local copy—aka, a “push.” Click on the push button on the top of the GitKraken screen and use the default options. If you refresh the Github page with your repository, it should now be updated with the information you’ve committed on your computer. If you’re always making changes on your own computer, you can keep using the commit cycle from before, and periodically push those changes to the remote (online) copy of the repository. However, it’s also possible (and common) that changes are made to the online copy that you’ll want to update on your own computer. To test this out, first make a change to the README.md file in your Github repository. You can do this by clicking on the file, clicking on the pencil icon on the top-right of the file, making a change, and then clicking the “Commit changes” button at the bottom of the page (Figure 7.3). Figure 7.3: Committing There are now changes in the online copy that are not in your local copy. To sync them back up, go back to GitKraken on your computer and click the “pull” button. The history of commits in the center pane should update to include the change you just made online. Note that we started with a repository on a computer and duplicated it online, but it can go the other way as well. Close the currently open repository in GitKraken. You should be back at a screen with several options, including “Clone a repo”. If you click on this button, you can paste in the link of a repository to download from the internet and where to put it on your computer. If you try this with the link to your own Github repository (but change the location on your computer), Git will download the same repository in a different place; if you open it, you’ll see that it looks exactly the same as the repository you just closed. The moral of the story is that you can create as many copies of a project repository as you want, but it’s a good idea to choose one of to be “official” version that always has the most-up-to-date copy of your changes. Frequently, this is the online copy, as it’s the easiest to access. Anytime you start working on a local copy of the repository, it’s a good idea to “pull” from the online copy to make sure you’re up-to-date, and then “push” at the end, to make sure your changes are available online. 7.7 Conflicts Even the most careful person will end up making changes in two different copies of the same repository and then trying to sync them together. Sometimes git is able to resolve the differences on its own, but sometimes the two changes conflict and can’t be automatically reconciled. We can create a conflict like this by making changes in our README.md file. First, make sure that your local repository and Github repository are synced up - that you have pushed all your local changes to Github and pulled all your Github changes to your local computer. Then, on your computer, make these changes to the README.md file: ## Meeting time - December 21, 2019 - 18:00 UTC Commit the changes as we’ve done before but do not push them to Github. Now, go to your repository on Github, click on the README.md file and edit it as follows: ## Meeting time - November 4, 2018 - 18:00 UTC Commit the changes. Now we have conflicting changes in our repository—one in the Github copy and one on our local computer copy. We want to sync our changes by either pushing from the copy on our computer to the Github copy or by pulling from the Github copy to our computer. It turns out that we can’t do the first option (try it and see what happens), so we’ll have to use the second option, of pulling from Github to our computer. When we try this, we should get a few red boxes that pop up saying “Pull failed” and/or “Merge failed”. Note that, when we try to push, we do have the option of using a “force push” to override whatever changes we made in Github. If you’re absolutely sure that there’s nothing in the Github copy you want, you can try this, but it’s generally a good idea to pull down the changes and look at the conflict, just to make sure. Because of the conflicting changes we made, the update of our local repository failed. Git doesn’t know which changes we really want and has pushed us into a temporary “conflict” state until we tell it specificallly which changes we want. To do this, click on “View conflict” (should be on the top right of the GitKraken window). Click on the file in conflict (README.md). This will open up a different view, where the two conflicting versions of the file are shown side by side. You can check the box picking one version, the other, or both, with the combined output shown in the window below. Once you’ve picked what you’re happy with, click the “Save” button on the top right, close the file by clicking the “X” and finish the update by clicking on “Commit and merge” (Figure 7.4). Figure 7.4: The Commit Process 7.8 Using Local vs Remote Repositories In the previous section, we set up an online copy of our project repository. This wasn’t too risky because our repository didn’t have any large file or confidential information. However, for some projects, that will be the case, which is why it’s important to think carefully before creating an online repository. Consider the following before you put it in an online repository: Size Github has file size limits; you won’t be allowed to upload files of a certain size. Projects with large data files often store their data in other places and then include directions of how to access it in the main project repository. Privacy - If your data includes identifying information or other confidential features, it should be placed in a location with the appropriate security. 7.9 To Git-finity, and Beyond Git was originally developed to manage a BIG and complex software project (development of the Linux operating system kernel) so as a version control system, it’s also BIG and complex, with a lot of features that aren’t needed for most everyday workflows, especially if you’re mostly working by yourself. This chapter has covered what is most essential, and hopefully, most useful. If you find yourself working on more complex projects, especially with multiple collaborators, you may want to learn more about some of git’s development and collaboration features. See (book 2?) for more information. 7.10 Exercises Abbie has started working on a data analysis project. She has a copy of the main data set, and sent her supervisor a preliminary report based on a script she has been writing. The response to her report was a lot of comments, and an updated version of the dataset. Meanwhile, she had a colleague look at her script and he refactored it into a more conventional coding standard. Where are some areas where Abbie could use version control to track her work? Make a change to README.md and commit the changes to the repository. How can you check that the changes were committed? FIXME: Screenshot of version history with this series of commits: “Initial commit”, “Adding script”, “Removing written in filename”, “Using new package functions”, “Adding multi-file capabilities.” How would you look at the difference between the current script and when it had the input filename written into the script? Manuel has a copy of his main repository on his laptop, work computer, and Github. If he has done work on his laptop while traveling, what steps does he need to go through to update the copy on his work computer? What should he have done before starting to work on his laptop to make this go as smoothly as possible? FIXME: Screenshot of message you get when there’s a pull/merge conflict What does this message indicate about the state of the repository? What would you do next? Which of these is/are examples of remote storage? GitHub Google Drive an external hard drive Name some pros and cons of each option. 7.11 Key Points A version control system allows you to record the history of changes to a file and recover older versions when needed. Each snapshot that captures information about a change is called a commit. Commits are stored in a version control repository, usually associated with a project folder and all its nested sub-folders. A version control tool like Git has commands that allow you to make commits, review them, and revert back to previous commits (if needed). Make commits frequently when actively working on a project. Version controlled repositories can be duplicated online or on other computers. A public respository can be duplicated and used to work on any computer. Large data files and private information should not be stored on a public version control repository. "],

Namespace A way of organizing names of related objects, functions, or variables to avoid confusion with (for instance) common names that might well occur in multiple packages. Nano FIXME Ngo FIXME Not Invented Here (NIH): FIXME Novice Someone who has not yet built a usable mental model of a domain. See also competent practitioner and expert.
