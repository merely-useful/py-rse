1.  To report a bug or request a new feature,
    please check the [list of open issues](https://github.com/tidyblocks/tidyblocks/issues)
    to see if it's already there,
    and if not,
    file as complete a description as you can.

1.  If you have made a fix or improvement,
    please create a [pull request](https://github.com/tidyblocks/tidyblocks/pulls).
    We will review these as quickly as we can (typically within 2-3 days).
    If you are tackling an issue that has already been opened,
    please name your branch `number-some-description`

## Style Guide {#contributing-style}

We follow the [tidyverse style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org/) for R and
[PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for Python as closely as
possible but specify some conventions further. We go against the style guides
only when it is considered that it will improve clarity.

Specific conventions include:

- `function_name()` and `method_name()` (snake_case, include parentheses)
- `variable_name` (snake_case)
- `folder-name/` (hyphens instead of underscores, trailing slash for clarity)
- `file-name` (hyphens instead of underscores)
- `'string'` and `"string"` (single or double quotes, It seems people prefer
  different options here)
- Method chaining in pandas:

    ```
    (dataframe
        .method()
        .method(short_arg)
        .method(
            long_arg1,
            long_arg2))
    ```

For markdown, we use ATX-headers (`#` prefix) rather than Setext headers (`=/-`
underlines), links with `[linkname][tag]` rather than `[linkname](url)`, and
fenced code blocks rather than indented blocks. More details on the writing
process can be found in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

There are more details for what we recommend for learners in
[style.Rmd](style.Rmd) (Python only so far). Discuss further in [issue
#116](https://github.com/merely-useful/merely-useful.github.io/issues/116).

Please note that we use Simplified English rather than Traditional English,
i.e., American rather than British spelling and grammar.
