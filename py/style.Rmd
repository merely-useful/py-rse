## Questions {#style-questions}

-   How should I name my variables and functions?
-   How should I organize my code so that other people can understand it?
-   How can I make functions more reusable?
-   What should my code do when an error occurs?

## Introduction {#style-intro}

To paraphrase @Dobz1973,
nothing in software development makes sense except in light of human psychology.
This is particularly true when we look at programming style.
Computers don't need to understand programs in order to execute them,
but people do in order to create them, maintain them, and fix them.
The more clearly those programs are laid out,
the easier it is to find things and make sense of them.
This lesson therefore describes some widely-used rules of Python programming style,
and some features of the language that you can use to make your programs more flexible and more readable.

The biggest benefit of having a second person work on a programming project
is therefore not getting twice as much code written,
but having code reviewed.
Study after study over more than 40 years has shown that code review is the most effective way to find bugs in software
@Faga1976,@Faga1986,@Cohe2010@Bacc2013.
Despite this,
it still isn't common in research software development,
in part because it isn't part of the culture @Sega2005,
but also because code review is mostly useful
when the reviewers understand the problem domain well enough to comment on algorithms and design choices
rather than indentation and variable naming,
and the number of people who can do that for a research project is typically very small---sometimes
as small as one @Petr2014.

This lesson will look at the mechanics of code review
and present some short examples of the kinds of things reviewers should look for.

## How should I review someone else's code: {#style-github}

How you review is just as important as what you look for:
being dismissive or combative are good ways to ensure that people don't pay attention to your reviews,
or avoid having you review their work.
Equally,
being defensive when someone offers suggestions politely and sincerely is very human,
but can stunt your development as a programmer.

Lots of people have written guidelines for doing reviews,
which are also useful when reviewing written work @Quen2018,@Sank2018.
A few key points are:

Work in small increments.
:   As @Cohe2010 and others have found,
    code review is most effective when done in short bursts.
    That means that change requests should also be short:
    anything that's more than a couple of screens long
    should be broken into smaller pieces.

Look for algorithmic problems first.
:   Code review isn't just (or even primarily) about style:
    its real purpose is to find bugs before they can affect anyone.
    The first pass over any change should therefore look for algorithmic problems.
    Are the calculations right?
    Are any rare cases going to be missed?
    Are errors being caught and handled Chapter \@ref(logging)?

Use a rubric.
:   Linters are great,
    but can't decide when someone should have used a lookup table instead of conditionals.
    A list of things to check for can make review faster and more comprehensible,
    especially when you can copy-and-paste or drag-and-drop specific comments
    onto specific lines
    (something that GitHub unfortunately doesn't yet support).

Ask for clarification.
:   If you don't understand something,
    or don't understand why the author did it,
    ask.
    (And when the author explains it,
    think about suggesting that the explanation ought to be documented somewhere.)

Offer alternatives.
:   Telling authors that something is wrong is helpful;
    telling them what they might do instead is more so.

Don't be sarcastic or disparaging.
:   "Did you maybe think about *testing* this garbage?"
    is a Code of Conduct violation in any well-run project.

Don't present opinions as facts.
:   "Nobody uses X any more" might be true.
    If it is,
    the person making the claim ought to be able to point at download statistics
    or a Google Trends search;
    if they can't,
    they should say,
    "I don't think anybody uses X any more" and explain why they think that.

Don't feign surprise or pass judgment.
:   "Gosh, didn't you know [some obscure fact]?" isn't helpful;
    neither is, "Geez, why don't you [some clever trick] here?"

Don't overwhelm people with details.
:   If someone has used the letter `x` as a variable name in several places,
    and they shouldn't have,
    comment on the first two or three and simply put a check beside the others---the reader
    won't need the comment repeated.

Don't ask people to do extra work.
:   Nobody enjoys fixing bugs and style violations.
    Asking them to add a few features while they're at it is rude.

Don't let people break these rules just because they're frequent contributors or in positions of power.
:   The culture of any organization is shaped by the worst behavior it is willing to tolerate @Grue2015.
    If you let people be rude to one another,
    *that* is your culture.

Be specific in replies to reviewers.
:   If someone has suggested a better variable name,
    you can probably simply fix it.
    If someone has suggested a major overhaul to an algorithm,
    you should reply to their comment to point at the commit that includes the fix.

Thank your reviewers.
:   If someone has taken the time to read your code carefully,
    thank them for doing it.

## What are the standard rules of good style for Python programs? {#style-pep8}

The single most important rule of style is to be consistent,
both internally and with other programs.
Python's standard style is called [PEP-8][pep-8];
the term "PEP" is short for "Python Enhancement Proposal",
and PEP-8 has become the most widely used standard for Python coding.
Some of its rules are listed below,
along with others borrowed from "[Code Smells and Feels][code-smells-and-feels]":

FIXME: add before-and-after examples for each of these.

### Always indent code blocks using 4 spaces, and use spaces instead of tabs.

### Do not put spaces inside parentheses

I.e., don't write <code>(&nbsp;1+2&nbsp;)</code>.
This applies to function calls as well:
do not write <code>max(&nbsp;a,&nbsp;b&nbsp;)</code>.

### Always use spaces around comparisons like `>` and `<=`.

Use your own judgment for spacing around common arithmetic operators like `+` and `/`.

### Use `ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES` for constants (also called global variables).

### Use `lower_case_with_underscores` for the names of functions and variables.

This naming convention is called [snake case](glossary.html#snake-case) or [pothole case](glossary.html#pothole-case).
You should only use [`CamelCase`](glossary.html#camel-case) for classes,
which are outside the scope of this lesson.

### Put two blank links between each function definition.

This helps them stand out.

### Avoid abbreviations in function and variable names.

They can be ambiguous,
and can be be hard for non-native speakers to understand.
This rule doesn't necessarily you will have to do more typing:
a good programming editor will [auto-complete](glossary.html#auto-completion) names for you.

### Use short names for short-lived local variables but longer names for things with wider scope.

Loop indices @Beni2017 can be `i` and `j` (provided the loop is only a few lines long).
Anything that is used at a greater distance
or whose purpose isn't immediately clear
(such as a function) should have a longer name.

### Put everything in a file in order.

The order of items in each file should be:

-   The [shebang](glossary.html#shebang) line (because it has to come first to work).
-   The file's documentation string (Chapter \@ref(style)).
-   All of the `import` statements, one per line.
-   Constant definitions.
-   Function definitions.
-   If the file can be run as a program,
    the `if __name__ == '__main__'` statement discussed in
    Section \@ref(rse-package-py-import).

### Do not comment and uncomment sections of code to change behavior.

If you need to do something in some runs of the program and not do it in others,
use an `if` statement to enable or disable that block of code.
It's much more reliable---you're far less likely to accidentally comment out one too many lines---and
you may find that you want to leave those conditional sections in the finished program
for logging purposes (Chapter \@ref(logging)).

### Keep functions short.

Nothing should be more than a page long
or have more than three levels of indentation because of nested loops and conditionals.
Anything longer or more deeply nested will be hard for readers to fit into [working memory](glossary.html#working-memory);
when you find yourself needing to break these limits,
extract a function (Section \@ref(refactor-extract-function)).

### Handle special cases at the start of the function.

This helps readers mentally get them out of the way
and focus on the "normal" case.
Section \@ref(refactor-short-circuits)
discusses this in more detail.

## How can I check that code follows style guidelines? {#style-check}

Checking that code conforms to guidelines like the ones above can be time consuming,
but luckily it doesn't have to be done by hand.
Most languages have tools that will check code style rules and report violations.
These are often called [linters](glossary.html#linter),
after an early tool called `[lint][lint]` that found lint (or fluff) in C code.
Python has a tool that used to be called `pep8`
and is now called `pycodestyle`
that will do this.
For example,
this program is supposed to count the number of stop words in a document:

<!-- src="style/count_stops_1.py" -->
```python
stops = ['a', 'A', 'the', 'The', 'and']

def count(ln):
    n = 0
    for i in range(len(ln)):
        line = ln[i]
        stuff = line.split()
        for word in stuff:
            # print(word)
            j = stops.count(word)
            if (j > 0) == True:
                n = n + 1
    return n

import sys

lines = sys.stdin.readlines()
# print('number of lines', len(lines))
n = count(lines)
print('number', n)
```

<!-- == noindent -->
When we run this command:

```shell
$ pycodestyle count_stops.py
```

<!-- == noindent -->
it prints this report:

```text
src/style/count_stops_before.py:3:1: E302 expected 2 blank lines, found 1
src/style/count_stops_before.py:11:24: E712 comparison to True should be 'if cond is True:' or 'if cond:'
src/style/count_stops_before.py:12:13: E101 indentation contains mixed spaces and tabs
src/style/count_stops_before.py:12:13: W191 indentation contains tabs
src/style/count_stops_before.py:15:1: E305 expected 2 blank lines after class or function definition, found 1
src/style/count_stops_before.py:15:1: E402 module level import not at top of file
```

Fixing these issues gives us this:

<!-- src="style/count_stops_2.py" -->
```python
import sys


stops = ['a', 'A', 'the', 'The', 'and']


def count(ln):
    n = 0
    for i in range(len(ln)):
        line = ln[i]
        stuff = line.split()
        for word in stuff:
            # print(word)
            j = stops.count(word)
            if j > 0:
                n = n + 1
    return n


lines = sys.stdin.readlines()
# print('number of lines', len(lines))
n = count(lines)
print('number', n)
```

This program gets a clean bill of health,
so it's worth looking at in more detail.
Here are things that should be changed:

-   The commented-out `print` statements should either be removed
    or turned into proper logging statements (Chapter \@ref(logging)).
-   The variables `ln`, `i`, and `j` should be given clearer names.
-   The outer loop in `count` loops over the indices of the line list
    rather than over the lines.
    It should do the latter
    (which will allow us to get rid of the variable `i`).
-   There's no reason to store the result of `line.split` in a temporary variable:
    the inner loop of `count` can use it directly.
-   Rather than counting how often a word occurs in the list of stop words
    and then adding 1 to `n`,
    we can create a set of stop words and use a simple membership test.
    This will be more readable *and* more efficient.
-   Since the set of stop words is a global variable,
    it should be written in upper case.
-   We should use `+=` to increment the counter `n`.
-   Rather than reading the input into a list of lines and then looping over that,
    we can give `count` a stream and have it process the lines one by one.
-   Since we might want to use `count` in other programs some day,
    we should put the two lines at the bottom that handle input
    into a conditional
    so that they aren't executed when this script is imported.

After making all these changes,
our little program looks like this:

<!-- src="style/count_stops_3.py" -->
```python
import sys


STOPS = {'a', 'A', 'the', 'The', 'and'}


def count(reader):
    n = 0
    for line in reader:
        for word in line.split():
            if word in STOPS:
                n += 1
    return n


if __name__ == '__main__':
    n = count(sys.stdin)
    print('number', n)
```

## How should I collaborate with people when doing code reviews? {#style-how}

FIXME: how to review on GitHub.

## In what order should functions be defined? {#style-order}

When encountering code for the first time,
most people scan it from top to bottom.
If that code is a program or script,
rather than a library,
its main function should be put first,
and should probably be called `main`.

After reading that function,
someone should have a good idea of what the program does in what order.
Three common patterns that people might match against are:

1.  Figure out what the user has asked it to do (Chapter \@ref(configure)).
2.  Read all input data.
3.  Process it.
4.  Write output.

<!-- == noindent -->
or:

1.  Figure out what the user has asked for.
2.  For each input file:
    1.  Read.
    2.  Process.
    3.  Write file-specific output (if any).
3.  Write summary output (if any).

<!-- == noindent -->
or:

1.  Figure out what the user has asked for.
2.  Repeatedly:
    1.  Wait for user input.
    2.  Do what the user has asked.
3.  Exit when a "stop" command of some sort is received.

Each step in each of the outlines above usually becomes a function.
Those functions depend on others,
some of which are written to break code into comprehensible chunks and are then called just once,
others of which are utilities that may be called many times from many different places.

FIXME: figure

Different people order these differently;
our preferred order is:

1.  Put all of the single-use functions in the first half of the file
    in the order in which they are likely to be called.
2.  Put all of the multi-use utility functions in the bottom of the file in alphabetical order.

If any of those utility functions are used by other scripts or programs,
they should go in a file of their own.
In fact,
this is a good practice even if they're only used by one program,
since it signals even more clearly which functions are in the "structural" layer
and which are in the "utility" layer.

## How can I specify default values for functions' parameters? {#style-defaults}

[Working memory](glossary.html#working-memory) can only hold a few items at once:
initial estimates in the 1950s put the number at 7 plus or minus 2 @Mill1956,
and more recent estimates put it as low as 4 or 5.
If your function requires two dozen parameters,
the odds are very good that users will frequently forget them
or put them in the wrong order.
One solution is to give parameters default values (Chapter \@ref(style));
another is to bundle them together so that (for example)
people pass three `point` objects instead of nine separate `x`, `y`, and `z` values.

A third approach (which can be combined with the preceding two)
is to specify default values for some of the parameters.
Doing this gives users control over everything
while also allowing them to ignore details;
it also codifies what you consider "normal" for the function.

For example,
suppose we are comparing images to see if they are the same or different.
We can specify two kinds of tolerance:
how large a difference in color value to notice,
and how many differences above that threshold to tolerate
(as a percentage of the total number of pixels).
By default,
any color difference is considered significant,
and only 1% of pixels are allowed to differ:

```python
def image_diff(left, right, per_pixel=0, fraction=0.01):
    # ...implementation...
```

<!-- == noindent -->
When this function is called using `image_diff(old, new)`,
those default values apply.
However,
it can also be called like this:

-   `image_diff(old, new, per_pixel=2)`
    allows pixels to differ slightly without those differences being significant.
-   `image_diff(old, new, fraction=0.05)` allows more pixels to differ.
-   `image_diff(old, new, per_pixel=1, fraction=0.005)`
    raises the per-pixel threshold but decrease number of allowed differences.

Default parameter values make code easier to understand and use,
but there is a subtle trap.
When Python executes a function definition like this:

```python
def collect(new_value, accumulator=set()):
    accumulator.add(new_value)
    return accumulator
```

<!-- == noindent -->
it calls `set()` to create a new empty set,
and then uses that set as the default value for `accumulator` every time the function is called.
It does *not* call `set()` anew for each call,
so all calls using the default will share the same set:

```python
>>> collect('first')
{'first'}
>>> collect('second')
{'first', 'second'}
```

A common way to avoid this is to pass `None` to the function
to signal that the user didn't provide a value:

```python
def collect(new_value, accumulator=None):
    if accumulator is None:
        accumulator = set()
    accumulator.add(new_value)
    return accumulator
```

## How can I write functions to handle a variable number of arguments? {#style-varargs}

We can often make programs simpler by writing functions that take a variable number of arguments,
just like `print` and `max`.
One way to to require user to stuff those arguments into a list,
e.g.,
to write `find_limits([a, b, c, d])`.
However,
Python can do this for us.
If we declare a single argument whose name starts with a single `*`,
Python will put all "extra" arguments into a [tuple](glossary.html#tuple)
and pass that as the argument.
By convention,
this argument is called `args`:

<!-- src="style/find_limits.py" -->
```python
def find_limits(*args):
    print(args)

find_limits(1, 3, 5, 2, 4)
```
```text
(1, 3, 5, 2, 4)
```

This catch-all parameter can be used with regular parameters,
but must come last in the parameter list to avoid ambiguity:

<!-- src="style/select_outside.py" -->
```python
def select_outside(low, high, *values):
    result = []
    for v in values:
        if (v < low) or (v > high):
            result.add(v)
    return result

print(select_outside(0, 1.0, 0.3, -0.2, -0.5, 0.4, 1.7))
```
```text
[-0.2, -0.5, 1.7]
```

An equivalent special form exists for named arguments:
the catch-all variable is conventionally called `kwargs`
(for "keyword arguments")
and its name is prefixed with `**` (i.e., two asterisks instead of one).
When this is used,
the function is given a [dictionary](glossary.html#dictionary) of names and values
rather than a list:

<!-- src="style/set_options.py" -->
```python
def set_options(tag, **kwargs):
    result = '<{}'.format(tag)
    for key in kwargs:
        result += ' {}="{}"'.format(key, kwargs[key])
    result += '/>'
    return result

print(set_options('h1', color='blue'))
print(set_options('p', align='center', size='150%'))
```
```text
<h1 color="blue"/>
<p align="center" size="150%"/>
```

<!-- == noindent -->
Notice that the names of parameters are not quoted:
the call is `color='blue'` and not `'color'='blue'`.

## How can I pass an unknown number of parameters? {#style-starargs}

We can use the inverse of `*args` and `**kwargs` to match a list of values to arguments.
In this case,
we put the `*` in front of a list and `**` in front of a dictionary when *calling* the function,
rather than in front of the parameter when *defining* it:

<!-- src="style/trim_value.py" -->
```python
def trim_value(data, low, high):
    print(data, "with", low, "and", high)

parameters = ['some matrix', 'lower bound']
named_parameters = {'high': 'upper bound'}
trim_value(*parameters, **named_parameters)
```
```text
some matrix with lower bound and upper bound
```

## How can I get values out of structured data more easily? {#style-destructure}

Modern programming languages have lots of other tools to make life more convenient for programmers.
One that's particularly useful is [destructuring](glossary.html#destructuring):

<!-- src="style/destructuring.py" -->
```python
[first, [second, third]] = [1, [2, 3]]
print(first)
print(second)
print(third)
```
```text
1
2
3
```

As this example shows,
if the variables on the left are arranged in the same way as the values on the right,
Python will automatically unpack the values and assign them correctly.
This is particularly useful when looping over lists of structured values:

<!-- src="style/looping.py" -->
```python
people = [
    [['Kay', 'McNulty'], 'mcnulty@eniac.org'],
    [['Betty', 'Jennings'], 'jennings@eniac.org'],
    [['Marlyn', 'Wescoff'], 'mwescoff@eniac.org']
]
for [[first, last], email] in people:
    print('{} {} <{}>'.format(first, last, email))
```
```text
Kay McNulty <mcnulty@eniac.org>
Betty Jennings <jennings@eniac.org>
Marlyn Wescoff <mwescoff@eniac.org>
```

## Summary {#style-summary}

George Orwell laid out [six rules for good writing][orwells-rules],
the last and most important of which is,
"Break any of these rules sooner than say anything outright barbarous."
PEP8 conveys the same message in the section [Foolish consistency is the
hobgoblin of little minds][pep-8-hobgoblin].
There will always be cases where your code will be easier to understand
if you *don't* do the things described in this lesson,
but there are probably fewer of them than you think.
