-   A shell is a program whose primary purpose is to read commands and run other programs.
-   The shell's main advantages are its high action-to-keystroke ratio,
    its support for automating repetitive tasks,
    and its capacity to access networked machines.
-   The shell's main disadvantages are its primarily textual nature and how cryptic its commands and operation can be.
-   The file system is responsible for managing information on the disk.
-   Information is stored in files, which are stored in directories (folders).
-   Directories can also store other directories, which forms a directory tree.
-   `cd path` changes the current working directory.
-   `ls path` prints a listing of a specific file or directory; `ls` on its own lists the current working directory.
-   `pwd` prints the user's current working directory.
-   `/` on its own is the root directory of the whole file system.
-   A relative path specifies a location starting from the current location.
-   An absolute path specifies a location from the root of the file system.
-   Directory names in a path are separated with `/` on Unix, but `\\` on Windows.
-   `..` means 'the directory above the current one'; `.` on its own means 'the current directory'.
-   `cp old new` copies a file.
-   `mkdir path` creates a new directory.
-   `mv old new` moves (renames) a file or directory.
-   `rm path` removes (deletes) a file.
-   `*` matches zero or more characters in a filename, so `*.txt` matches all files ending in `.txt`.
-   `?` matches any single character in a filename, so `?.txt` matches `a.txt` but not `any.txt`.
-   Use of the Control key may be described in many ways, including `Ctrl-X`, `Control-X`, and `^X`.
-   The shell does not have a trash bin: once something is deleted, it's really gone.
-   Most files' names are `something.extension`.
    The extension isn't required and doesn't guarantee anything,
    but is normally used to indicate the type of data in the file.
-   Depending on the type of work you do, you may need a more powerful text editor than Nano.
-   `cat` displays the contents of its inputs.
-   `head` displays the first 10 lines of its input.
-   `tail` displays the last 10 lines of its input.
-   `sort` sorts its inputs.
-   `wc` counts lines, words, and characters in its inputs.
-   `command > file` redirects a command's output to a file (overwriting any existing content).
-   `command >> file` appends a command's output to a file.
-   `<` operator redirects input to a command
-   `first | second` is a pipeline: the output of the first command is used as the input to the second.
-   The best way to use the shell is to use pipes to combine simple single-purpose programs (filters).
-   A `for` loop repeats commands once for every thing in a list.
-   Every `for` loop needs a variable to refer to the thing it is currently operating on.
-   Use `$name` to expand a variable (i.e., get its value). `${name}` can also be used.
-   Do not use spaces, quotes, or wildcard characters such as '*' or '?' in filenames, as it complicates variable expansion.
-   Give files consistent names that are easy to match with wildcard patterns to make it easy to select them for looping.
-   Use the up-arrow key to scroll up through previous commands to edit and repeat them.
-   Use `Ctrl-R` to search through the previously entered commands.
-   Use `history` to display recent commands, and `!number` to repeat a command by number.
