-   Use a \gref{branch-per-feature}{branch_per_feature} workflow to develop new features while leaving the master branch in working order.
-   `git branch` creates a new branch. 
-   `git checkout` switches between branches.
-   `git merge` \gref{merges}{git_merge} changes from another branch into the current branch.
-   \gref{Conflicts}{git_conflict} occur when files or parts of files are changed in different ways on different branches.
-   Version control systems do not allow people to overwrite changes silently;
    instead, they highlight conflicts that need to be resolved.
-   \gref{Forking}{git_fork} a repository makes a copy of it on a server.
-   \gref{Cloning}{git_clone} a repository with `git clone` creates a local copy of a remote repository.
-   Create a remote called `upstream` to point to the repository a fork was derived from.
-   Create \gref{pull requests}{pull_request} to submit changes from your fork to the upstream repository.
