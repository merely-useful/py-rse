## Introduction {#docs-intro}

An old proverb says, "Trust, but verify."
The equivalent in programming is, "Be clear, but document."
No matter how well software is written,
it always embodies decisions that aren't explicit in the final code
or accommodates complications that aren't going to be obvious to the next reader.
Putting it another way,
the best function names in the world aren't going to answer the questions
"Why does the software do this?"
and
"Why doesn't it do this in a simpler way?"
This lesson will explore who we should write documentation for,
what we should write for them,
and where it should go.

## How can I write useful error messages? {#docs-error-messages}

The error message shown in Figure \@ref(fig:docs-error-message) is not helpful:

```{r docs-error-message, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Error Message"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/docs/error-message.png")
```

<!-- == noindent -->
Neither is this:

```text
System.InvalidOperationException: Nullable object must have a value.
```

<!-- == noindent -->
or this:

```text
I tried really hard but was unable to complete your request.
You probably need to talk to a human - have you tried calling Dave?
```

Error messages are often the first thing people actually read about a piece of software
(or possibly the second if they had to install it themselves),
so they should therefore be the most carefully written documentation for that software.
A quick web search for "writing good error messages" turns up hundreds of hits,
but recommendations are often more like gripes than solid guidelines
and are usually not backed up by evidence.
What research there is @Trav2010,@Beck2016 gives us the following rules:

1.  Do not tell the user what the program did that caused the problem,
    but what the user did.
    Putting it another way,
    the message shouldn't state the effect of the error,
    it should state the cause.   

2.  Be spatially correct,
    i.e.,
    point at the actual location of the error.
    Few things are as frustrating as being pointed at line 28
    when the problem is really on line 35.

3.  Do not provide tips or potential solutions.
    In most languages it is not possible to determine what the actual error is from the message with 100% certainty.
    Therefore it is better to give an as-specific-as-possible message on what went wrong without offering guidance on fixing it.
    Tips and hints could be provided by a different tool,
    but they should be based on the error message and not part of it.

4.  Be as specific as possible without ever being (or seeming) wrong:
    from a user's point of view,
    "file not found" is very different from "don't have permissions to open file" or "file is empty".

5.  Write for your audience's level of understanding.
    For example, error messages should never use programming terms more advanced than
    those you would use to describe the code the user wrote.

6.  Do not blame the user, and do not use words like fatal, illegal, etc.
    The former can frustrate---in many cases, "user error" actually isn't---and
    the latter can make people worry that the program has damaged their data,
    their computer,
    or their reputation.

7.  Do not try to make the computer sound like a human being.
    In particular, avoid humor:
    very few jokes are funny on the dozenth re-telling,
    and most users are going to see error messages at least that often.

8.  Use a consistent vocabulary.
    This rule can be hard to enforce when error messages are written by several different people,
    but putting them all in one module makes review easier.

That last suggestion deserves a little elaboration.
Most people write error messages directly in their code:

```python
try:
    # ...do something complicated...
except OSError as e:
    print('Unable to find or read file {}'.format(filename))
    sys.exit(1)
```

<!-- == noindent -->
A better approach for large projects is to put all of the error messages in a catalog:

```python
ERROR_MESSAGES = {
    'cannot_read_file' : 'Unable to find or read file {}',
    'config_corrupted' : 'Configuration file {} corrupted',
    # ...more error messages...
}
```

<!-- == noindent -->
and then only use messages from that catalog:

```python
from error_messages import ERROR_MESSAGES

try:
    # ...do something complicated...
except OSError as e:
    print(ERROR_MESSAGES['cannot_read_file'].format(filename))
    sys.exit(1)
```

<!-- == noindent -->
Doing this makes it much easier to ensure that messages are consistent.
It also makes it much easier to give messages in the user's preferred language:


```python
ERROR_MESSAGES = {
    'en' : {
        'cannot_read_file' : 'Unable to find or read file {}',
        'config_corrupted' : 'Configuration file {} corrupted',
        # ...more error messages in English...
    },
    'fr' : {
        'cannot_read_file' : 'Impossible d'acceder au fichier {}',
        'config_corrupted' : 'Fichier de configuration {} corrompu',
        # ...more error messages in French...
    }
    # ...other languages...
}
```

<!-- == noindent -->
The error report is then looked up as:

```python
ERROR_MESSAGES[user_language]['cannot_read_file']
```

<!-- == noindent -->
where `user_language` is a two-letter code for the user's preferred language.

## What should I document for whom? {#docs-what}

There are three kinds of people in any domain:
[novices](glossary.html#novice), [competent practitioners](glossary.html#competent-practitioner), and [experts](glossary.html#expert) @Wils2018.
A novice doesn't yet have a [mental model](glossary.html#mental-model) of the domain;
they don't know what the key terms are,
how they relate,
what the causes of their problems are,
or how to tell whether a solution to their problem is appropriate or not.

Competent practitioners know enough to accomplish routine tasks with routine effort:
they may need to check [Stack Overflow(stack-overflow) every few minutes,
but they know what to search for and what "done" looks like.
Finally,
experts have such a deep and broad understanding of the domain
that they can solve routine problems at a glance
and are able to handle the one-in-a-thousand cases
that would baffle the merely competent.

Each of these three groups needs a different kind of documentation.
A novice needs a tutorial that introduces her to key ideas one by one
and shows how they fit together.
A competent practitioner needs reference guides, cookbooks, and Q&A sites;
these give her solutions close enough to what she needs
that she can tweak them the rest of the way.
Experts need this material as well---nobody's memory is perfect---but
they may also paradoxically want tutorials.
The difference between them and novices is that experts want tutorials on how things work
and why they were designed that way.

The first thing to decide when writing documentation
is therefore to decide which of these needs you are trying to meet.
Tutorials like this one should be long-form prose that contain code samples and diagrams.
They should use [authentic tasks](glossary.html#authentic-task) to motivate ideas,
i.e.,
show people things they actually want to do rather than printing the numbers from 1 to 10,
and should include regular check-ins
so that learners and instructors alike can tell if they're making progress.
If you would like to know more about creating tutorials,
please see @Wils2018.

Tutorials help novices build a mental model,
but competent practitioners and experts will be frustrated by their slow pace and low information density.
They will want single-point solutions to specific problems like
how to find cells in a spreadsheet that contain a certain string
or how to configure the web server to load an access control module.
They can make use of an alphabetical list of the functions in a library,
but are much happier if they can search by keyword to find what they need;
one of the signs that someone is no longer a novice is that
they're able to compose useful queries and tell if the results are on the right track or not.

That observation brings us to the notion of a [false beginner](glossary.html#false-beginner),
which is someone who appears not to know anything,
but who has enough prior experience in other domains
to be able to piece things together much more quickly than a genuine novice.
Someone who is proficient with MATLAB, for example,
will speed through a tutorial on Python's numerical libraries
much more quickly than someone who has never programmed before.

In an ideal world,
we would satisfy these needs with a [chorus of explanations][caulfield-chorus],
some long and detailed,
others short and to the point.
In our world, though,
time and resources are limited,
so all but the most popular packages must make do with single explanations.
The rest of this section will therefore look at
how to create reference guides and FAQs.

## How should I write documentation for code? {#docs-docstrings}

Instead of writing comments to document code,
Python encourages us to write [docstrings](glossary.html#docstring)
(short for "documentation string").
A docstring is a string placed at the start of a file or function
but not assigned to a variable.
If it appears at the start of a file,
and the file is loaded using `import module`,
the string is made available as `module.__doc__` (with two underscores).
If it is placed at the start of a function called `func`,
the string becomes `func.__doc__`.
Python's built-in `help` function looks up this string,
formats it using the rules like [Markdown][markdown]'s,
and displays it,
so `help(module)` or `help(func)` displays something useful.

Docstrings are usually written in triple quotes so that they can span multiple lines,
and to make them stand out from strings that are being used as data.
For example,
here's a file `trim.py` that has a one-sentence docstring for the module as a whole
and a multi-line docstring for the function `trim`:

<!-- src="docs/trim.py" -->
```python
'''
Tools for trimming values to lie in a specified range.
'''

def trim(values, low, high, in_place=False):
    '''
    Ensure that all values in the result list lie in low...high (inclusive).
    If 'in_place' is 'True', modifies the input instead of creating a new list.

    Args:
        values: List of values to be trimmed.
        low: Lower bound on values (inclusive).
        high: Upper bound on values (inclusive).
        in_place: If true, modify input list (default False).

    Returns:
        List of trimmed values (which may be the input list).

    Raises:
        AssertionError: if 'low' is greater than 'high'.
    '''
    assert low <= high, 'Nonsensical trim range {}..{}'.format(low, high)
    result = values if in_place else values[:]
    for (i, x) in enumerate(result):
        result[i] = min(high, max(low, x))
    return result
```

If we run the shell command:

```shell
pydoc bin/trim.py`
```

<!-- == noindent -->
Python will read the Python file,
extract the docstrings,
and create a nicely-formatted listing:

<!-- src="docs/trim.txt" -->
```
NAME
    trim - Tools for trimming values to lie in a specified range.

FUNCTIONS
    trim(values, low, high, in_place=False)
        Ensure that all values in the result list lie in low...high (inclusive).
        If 'in_place' is 'True', modifies the input instead of creating a new list.

        Args:
            values: List of values to be trimmed.
            low: Lower bound on values (inclusive).
            high: Upper bound on values (inclusive).
            in_place: If true, modify input list (default False).

        Returns:
            List of trimmed values (which may be the input list).

        Raises:
            AssertionError: if 'low' is greater than 'high'.

FILE
    /Users/pterry/magic/bin/trim.py
```

We get the same output from within the Python interpreter with:

```python
import trim
help(trim)
```

<!-- == noindent -->
or we can run `pydoc -w bin/trim.py` to generate an HTML page
(with some rather garish coloring).

We can go further and use a more sophisticated (i.e., more powerful but also more complicated) tool called [Sphinx][sphinx].
It reads a superset of Markdown called [reStructredText](glossary.html#restructured-text)
and generates. cross-indexed documentation that is more nicely formatted than `pydoc`'s default output.
Sphinx is used by by [ReadTheDocs][readthedocs],
which extracts and formats documentation from GitHub repositories and other places.
One benefit of ReadTheDocs is that it puts documentation in an easily-findable place;
the other is that it automatically regenerates that documentation every time there's a change to the repository
(an example of [continuous integration](glossary.html#continuous-integration)).
It's a great service,
but it's out of the scope of this lesson.

## What should I document? {#docs-infer}

The answer to the question in this section's title depends on what stage of development you are in.
If you are doing [exploratory programming](glossary.html#exploratory-programming),
a short docstring to remind yourself of each function's purpose is good enough.
(In fact, it's probably better than what most people do.)
That one- or two-liner should begin with an active verb and describe either
how inputs are turned into outputs,
or what side effects the function has;
as we discuss below,
if you need to describe both,
you should probably rewrite your function.

An active verb is something like "extract", "normalize", or "find".
For example,
these are all good one-line docstrings:

-   "Create a list of current ages from a list of birth dates."
-   "Clip signals to lie in [0...1]."
-   "Reduce the red component of each pixel."

You can tell your one-liners are useful if you can read them aloud in the order the functions are called
in place of the function's name and parameters.

Once you start writing code for other people---including yourself three months from now---your
docstrings should describe:

1.  The name and purpose of every public class, function, and constant in your code.
2.  The name, purpose, and default value (if any) of every parameter to every function.
3.  Any side effects the function has.
4.  The type of value returned by every function.
5.  What exceptions those functions can raise and when.

The word "public" in the first rule is important.
You don't have to write full documentation for helper functions
that are only used inside your package and aren't meant to be called by users,
but these should still have at least a comment explaining their purpose.
You also don't have to document unit testing functions:
as discussed in Chapter \@ref(unit),
these should have long names that describe what they're checking
so that failure reports are easy to scan.

## How can I create a useful FAQ? {#docs-faq}

An [FAQ](glossary.html#faq) is a list of frequently-asked questions and corresponding answers.
A good FAQ uses the terms and concepts that people bring to the software
rather than the vocabulary of its authors;
putting it another way,
the questions should be things that people might search for online,
and the answers should give them enough information to solve their problem.

Creating and maintaining a FAQ is a lot of work,
and unless the community is large and active,
a lot of that effort may turn out to be wasted,
because it's hard for the authors or maintainers of a piece of software
to anticipate what newcomers will be mystified by.
A better approach is to leverage sites like [Stack Overflow][stack-overflow],
which is where most programmers are going to look for answers anyway:

1.  Post every question that someone actually asks you,
    whether it's online, by email, or in person.
    Be sure to include the name of the software package in the question
    so that it's findable.
2.  Answer the question,
    making sure to mention which version of the software you're talking about
    (so that people can easily spot and discard stale answers in the future).

<!-- == noindent -->
With a bit of work,
the [Stack Exchange Data Explorer][stack-exchange-data-explorer]
can be used to download questions and answers about your software
if you want to put them all in an offline guide.
You can also use [Stack Printer][stack-printer] for this;
for example, the URL
<http://www.stackprinter.com/topvoted?service=stackoverflow&tagged=rstudio>
will bring up a paged view of top-voted questions about RStudio.

[Stack Overflow][stack-overflow]'s guide to [asking a good question][stack-overflow-good-question]
has been refined over many years,
and is a good guide for any project:

Write the most specific title you can.
:   "Why does division sometimes give a different result in Python 2.7 and Python 3.5?"
    is much better than, "Help! Math in Python!!"

Give context before giving sample code.
:   A few sentences to explain what you're trying to do and why
    will help people determine if their question is a close match to yours or not.

Provide a minimal reprex.
:   Chapter \@ref(backlog) explained the value of a [reproducible example](glossary.html#reprex) (reprex),
    and why reprexes should be as short as possible.
    Readers will have a much easier time figuring out if this question and its answers are for them
    if they can see *and understand* a few lines of code.

Tag, tag, tag.
:   Keywords make everything more findable,
    from scientific papers and left-handed musical instruments
    to solutions for programming problems.

Use "I" and question words (how/what/when/where/why).
:   The section headings in these lessons follow this rule for the same reason that questions in a FAQ should:
    writing this way forces you to think more clearly about
    what someone might actually be thinking when they need help.

Keep each item short.
:   The "minimal manual" approach to instructional design @Carr2014
    breaks everything down into single-page steps,
    with half of that page devoted to troubleshooting.
    This may feel like baby steps to the person doing the writing,
    but is often as much as a person searching and reading can handle.
    It also helps writers realize just how much implicit knowledge they are assuming.

Allow for a chorus of explanations.
:   As discussed [earlier](#docs-what),
    users are all different from one another,
    and are therefore best served by a chorus of explanations.
    Do not be afraid of providing multiple explanations to a single question
    that suggest different approaches
    or are written for different prior levels of understanding.

## Summary {#docs-summary}

> How can I tell you what I think till I see what I say?
>
> -- E.M. Forster

Writing documentation will sometimes give you ideas about how to improve the code.
For example,
if you need to document something in the middle of a function,
you should probably put it in a separate function.
Similarly,
if you have to use the word "and" more than once to describe what a function does,
your documentation is probably telling you that the function is trying to do too many things.
