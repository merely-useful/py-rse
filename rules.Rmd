# The Rules {#rules}

1.  Be kind: all else is details.
2.  A week of hard work can sometimes save you an hour of thought.
3.  While the hand makes the tool, the tool shapes the hand.
4.  Nothing in software development makes sense except in light of human psychology.
5.  If you need to write a parser, you've done something wrong.
6.  Always seed your random number generator, and always record the seed.
7.  Break any of these rules rather than doing something awkward.
