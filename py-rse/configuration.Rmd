# Program Configuration {#configuration}

In previous chapters we've used command-line options to configure our word count scripts. 
Depending on how complex we'd like to make our programs,
there are actually a number of layers of configuration that we could use:

1.  A system-wide configuration file for general settings.
2.  A user-specific configuration file for personal preferences.
3.  A job-specific file with settings for a specific run.
4.  Command-line options to change things that commonly change.

This is sometimes called [overlay configuration][overlay-configuration]
because each level overrides the ones above it:
the user's configuration file overrides the system settings,
the job configuration overrides the user's defaults,
and the command-line options overrides that.
While this is far more complexity than most research software needs (at least initially),
being able to read a complete set of options from a file is a big boost to reproducibility.

Your Zipf's Law project should now include:

```text
├── Makefile
├── README.md
├── bin
│   ├── book_summary.sh
│   ├── collate.py
│   ├── countwords.py
│   ├── mymodule.py

│   ├── dracula.txt
│   └── ...
└── results
    ├── dracula.csv
    ├── dracula.png

```

In this chapter,
we'll explore approaches for configuring our project,
and apply one approach to our Zipf's Law project.

> **Be Careful When Applying Settings Outside Your Project**
>
> This chapter discusses approaches that modify files outside of your Zipf's Law project.
> These examples are included to illustrate the concepts.
> We do not recommend making these changes to files outside the project,
> or if you do choose to alter these files,
> remember to change them back to default later.

## Configuration file formats {#configuration-formats}

Programmers have invented many formats for configuration files,
so please do not create your own.
One possibility is to write the configuration as a Python data structure
and then load it as if it was a library.
This is clever,
but it's hard for tools in other languages to process.
A second option is the [Windows INI format][ini-format],
which is laid out like this:

```text
[section_1]
key_1=value_1
key_2=value_2

[section_2]
key_3=value_3
key_4=value_4
```

INI files are simple to read and write,
but the format is slowly falling out of use in favor of [YAML][yaml]
(Appendix \@ref(yaml)).
Here's a sample YAML configuration file:

```yaml
# Standard settings for thesis.
logfile: "/tmp/log.txt"
quiet: false
overwrite: false
fonts:
- Verdana
- Serif
```

## Matplotlib configuration {#configuration-matplotlib}

To see overlay configuration in action,
let's consider one of the most common tasks in data science --
changing the size of the labels on a plot.
The size of the labels on our Jane Eyre plot
is fine for viewing on our screen,
but they'll need to be bigger
if we want to include the figure in a powerpoint presentation or report.

```{r configuration-jane-eyre-default, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Word frequency distribution for the book Jane Eyre with default label sizes."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/py-rse/configuration/jane_eyre_default.png")
```

In order to configure the label sizes,
we could use any of the overlay options described above:

-  Edit the system-wide matplotlib configuration YAML file known as the `matplotlibrc` file
-  Create a user-specific matplotlib style sheet (which also uses the YAML format) 
-  Create a job-specific YAML file that the `plotcounts.py` script can parse
-  Add some new command-line options to `plotcounts.py` 

Let's consider these options one at a time.

### Edit the matplotlibrc file

Our first option would be to edit the system-wide matplotlib runtime configuration file
(a.k.a. the `matplotlibrc` file).
When we import matplotlib,
it locates this YAML file in order to set the default characteristics
of the plot (i.e. colors, sizes, etc). 
We can find its location on our system by running the following command:

```python
import matplotlib as mpl
mpl.matplotlib_fname()
```

```text
/Users/amira/opt/anaconda3/lib/python3.7/site-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/matplotlibrc
```

In this case the file is located in Amira's Anaconda (`anaconda3`) directory.
All the different Python packages installed along with Anaconda
live in a `python3.7/site-packages` directory, including matplotlib.
We can see from opening the `matplotlibrc` file that it lists all the default settings as comments.
The default size of the x and y axis labels and also the tick labels is medium:

```yaml
#axes.labelsize       : medium  ## fontsize of the x any y labels
#xtick.labelsize      : medium  ## fontsize of the tick labels
#ytick.labelsize      : medium  ## fontsize of the tick labels
```

We could uncomment those lines, change the sizes,

```yaml
axes.labelsize       : x-large  ## fontsize of the x any y labels
xtick.labelsize      : large    ## fontsize of the tick labels
ytick.labelsize      : large    ## fontsize of the tick labels
```
and then re-generate the Jane Eyre plot with bigger labels:

```python
$ python plotcounts.py jane_eyre.csv --outfile jane_eyre.png
```

```{r configuration-jane-eyre-big-labels, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Word frequency distribution for the book Jane Eyre with larger label sizes."}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/py-rse/configuration/jane_eyre_big_labels.png")
```

While we've successfully edited the plot,
there are a couple of issues with this solution.
The first is that because the `matplotlibrc` file sets the system-wide defaults,
we've locked ourselves into default big labels for any/all plotting we do in future,
which may not be desirable.
Secondly, we ultimately want to package up our Zipf's Law code and make it available
to other people to use.
We don't have access to their `matplotlibrc` file,
it's not a solution that can be scaled up to multiple users.

### Create a matplotlib style sheet

Instead of directly editing the `matplotlibrc` file to change
the default plot characteristics,
there are a number of pre-defined styles provided by Matplotlib:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
print(plt.style.available)
```

```text
['seaborn-dark', 'seaborn-darkgrid', 'seaborn-ticks', 'fivethirtyeight', 'seaborn-whitegrid', 'classic', '_classic_test', 'fast', 'seaborn-talk', 'seaborn-dark-palette', 'seaborn-bright', 'seaborn-pastel', 'grayscale', 'seaborn-notebook', 'ggplot', 'seaborn-colorblind', 'seaborn-muted', 'seaborn', 'Solarize_Light2', 'seaborn-paper', 'bmh', 'tableau-colorblind10', 'seaborn-white', 'dark_background', 'seaborn-poster', 'seaborn-deep']
```

If we wanted to make sure our plots are accessible to people with color vision challenges,
for instance, we could choose that style at the beginning of our script:

```python
plt.style.use('tableau-colorblind10')
```

Following this approach, in order to make the labels bigger on our Jane Eyre plot
we could create our own custom matplotlib style sheet.
The convention is to store custom style sheets in a new `stylelib` sub-directory
in the matplotlib configuration directory.
That directory can be located by running the following command:

```python
mpl.get_configdir()
```

```text
/Users/amira/.matplotlib
```

Once we've created the new sub-directory,

```shell
$ mkdir /Users/amira/.matplotlib/stylelib
```

we could put a new file in there called
`/Users/amira/.matplotlib/stylelib/big-labels.mplstyle`
that follows the same YAML format as the `matplotlibrc` file:

```python
axes.labelsize   : x-large  ## fontsize of the x any y labels
xtick.labelsize  : large    ## fontsize of the tick labels
ytick.labelsize  : large    ## fontsize of the tick labels
```

To use this new style,
we would just need to add one line to the `plotcounts.py` script:

```python
plt.style.use('big-labels')
```

Using a custom style sheet fixes one of the problems we identified
with editing `matplotlibrc` directly: the system-wide defaults are unchanged.
However, because this solution is user-specific
(i.e. each user has their own `stylelib` directory),
it doesn't fix the issue of scaling up to multiple users.
It's a great way to achieve a consistent look across your personal data visualization projects,
but we need another solution for code we want to package for wider use.

### New command line options

One option that would scale to multiple users is additional command line arguments.
This would involve editing `plotcounts.py` to define new optional inputs:

```python
mpl_sizes = ['xx-small', 'x-small', 'small', 'medium', 'large', 'x-large', 'xx-large']
parser.add_argument('--labelsize', type=str, default='x-large', choices=mpl_sizes,
                    help='fontsize of the x any y labels')
parser.add_argument('--xticksize', type=str, default='large', choices=mpl_sizes,
                    help='fontsize of the x tick labels')
parser.add_argument('--yticksize', type=str, default='large', choices=mpl_sizes,
                    help='fontsize of the y tick labels')
```

We could then add a few lines after the `ax` variable is defined in `plotcounts.py`
to update the label sizes according to the user input,

```python
ax.xaxis.label.set_fontsize(args.labelsize)
ax.yaxis.label.set_fontsize(args.labelsize)
ax.xaxis.set_tick_params(labelsize=args.xticksize)
ax.yaxis.set_tick_params(labelsize=args.yticksize)
```

or we could dynamically change the default runtime configuration settings
before the plot is created,
which are stored in a dictionary-like variable called `matplotlib.rcParams`: 

```python
mpl.rcParams['axes.labelsize'] = args.labelsize
mpl.rcParams['xtick.labelsize'] = args.xticksize
mpl.rcParams['ytick.labelsize'] = args.yticksize
```

Adding extra command line arguments is a reasonable solution
if we only want to edit a small number of plot characteristics,
but the number of new arguments could quickly get out of hand
if we wanted to tweak other aspects of the plot
(we saw in the `matplotlibrc` file that there are hundreds of parameters we could change). 
For this particular example (i.e. matplotlib configuration),
we ideally want a solution that can easily scale up to handling many parameters. 

### Job-specific YAML file

The final option -- and the one that we'll adopt for `plotcounts.py` --
is to pass a single YAML file to `plotcounts.py` containing the matplotlib parameters
that we want to change.
In other words,
we can take the YAML file we discussed earlier (let's call it `rcparams.yml`),

```python
axes.labelsize   : x-large  ## fontsize of the x any y labels
xtick.labelsize  : large    ## fontsize of the tick labels
ytick.labelsize  : large    ## fontsize of the tick labels
```

Because this file is located in our project directory,
instead of creating a user-specific style sheet through `/Users/amira/.matplotlib/stylelib/`,
we can pass it directly to the script
by defining a single new command line argument in `plotcounts.py` :

```python
parser.add_argument('--rcparams', type=str, default=None,
                    help='YAML file containing new matplotlib runtime configuration parameters')
```

In the same script,
we can use the YAML library in Python to read the file:

```python
with open('rcparams.yml', 'r') as reader:
    rcparam_dict = yaml.load(reader, Loader=yaml.BaseLoader)
print(rcparam_dict)
```

```text
{'axes.labelsize': 'x-large',
 'xtick.labelsize': 'large',
 'ytick.labelsize': 'large'}
```

and then iterate over each item in the resulting dictionary to update `mpl.rcparams`:

```python
for param, value in param_dict.items():
    mpl.rcParams[param] = value
```

Applying this solution to `plotcounts.py` results in the following complete script:

```python
"""Plot word counts."""
import argparse
import yaml
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib as mpl
from scipy.optimize import minimize_scalar


def nlog_likelihood(beta, counts):

## Summary {#configuration-summary}

Tweaking the default matplotlib settings is a great example of the different
configuration options you can use in your programming.
Adding command line options to your scripts is a natural starting point
(and will be all the complexity you'll need in many cases),
but system-wide and user-specific configuration can be a great option for standardising
settings across your all or selected aspects of your personal work,
while job-specific configuration can be a good option if you're looking to scale up
to multiple users and/or a large number of configuration options.
