# Error Handling {#errors}

People will give our programs options that aren't supported
or ask those programs to read files that don't exist.
Our code will also inevitably contain bugs,
so we should plan from the start to catch and handle errors.

Your Zipf's Law project should now include:

In this chapter,
we'll explore different types of errors,
how they are communicated using code,
and apply them to our Zipf's Law project.

## What are exceptions? {#errors-what}

Most modern programming languages use [exceptions][exception] for error handling.
As the name suggests,
an exception is a way to represent an exceptional or unusual occurrence
that doesn't fit neatly into the program's expected operation.
The code below shows a very simple example that tests different denominators and
reports attempts to divide by zero:

```python
for denom in [-5, 0, 5]:
    try:
        result = 1/denom
        print('1/{} == {}'.format(denom, result))
    except:
        print('Cannot divide by {}'.format(denom))
```

```text
1/-5 == -0.2
Cannot divide by 0
1/5 == 0.2
```

`try`/`except` looks like `if`/`else` and works in a similar fashion.
If nothing unexpected happens inside the `try` block,
the `except` block isn't run (Figure \@ref(fig:errors-control-flow)).
If something *does* happen inside the `try`,
the program jumps immediately to the `except`.
This is why the `print` statement inside the `try` doesn't run when `denom` is 0:
as soon as Python tries to calculate `1/denom`,
it skips directly to the error message.

```{r errors-control-flow, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Exception Control Flow"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/py-rse/errors/exceptions.png")
```

We often want to know exactly what went wrong,
so Python and other languages store information about the error
in an object called an exception.
We can [catch][catch] an exception and inspect it as follows:

```python
for denom in [-5, 0, 5]:
    try:
        result = 1/denom
        print('1/{} == {}'.format(denom, result))
    except Exception as error:
        print('{} has no reciprocal: {}'.format(denom, error))
```

```text
1/-5 == -0.2
0 has no reciprocal: division by zero
1/5 == 0.2
```

We can use any variable name we like instead of `error`;
Python will assign the exception object to that variable
so that we can do things with it in the `except` block.

Python also allows us to specify what kind of exception we want to catch.
For example,
we can write code to handle out-of-range indexing and division by zero separately:

```python
numbers = [-5, 0, 5]
for i in [0, 1, 2, 3]:
    try:
        denom = numbers[i]
        result = 1/denom
        print('1/{} == {}'.format(denom, result))
    except IndexError as error:
        print('index {} out of range'.format(i))
    except ZeroDivisionError as error:
        print('{} has no reciprocal: {}'.format(denom, error))
```

```text
1/-5 == -0.2
0 has no reciprocal: division by zero
1/5 == 0.2
index 3 out of range
```

Exceptions are organized in a hierarchy:
for example,
`FloatingPointError`, `OverflowError`, and `ZeroDivisionError`
are all special cases of `ArithmeticError`,
so an `except` that catches the latter will catch all three of the former,
but an `except` that catches an `OverflowError`
*won't* catch a `ZeroDivisionError`.
The Python documentation describes all of[the built-in exception types][python-exceptions];
in practice,
the ones that people handle most often are:

-   `ArithmeticError`:
    something has gone wrong in a calculation.
-   `IndexError` and `KeyError`:
    something has gone wrong indexing a list or lookup something up in a dictionary.
-   `OSError`:
    covers cases like a file not being found,
    the program not having permission to read or write it,
    and so on.

So where do exceptions come from?
The answer is that programmers can [raise][raise] them explicitly:

```python
for number in [1, 0, -1]:
    try:
        if number < 0:
            raise ValueError('negative values not supported: {}'.format(number))
        print(number)
    except ValueError as error:
        print('exception: {}'.format(error))
```

```text
1
0
exception: negative values not supported: -1
```

We can define our own exception types,
and many libraries do,
but the built-in types are enough to cover common cases.

One final note is that exceptions don't have to be handled where they are raised—in fact,
their greatest strength is that they allow long-range error handling.
If an exception occurs inside a function and there is no `except` for it there,
Python looks in whoever called that function.
It keeps working its way through the [call stack][call-stack]
until it finds a matching `except`;
if there isn't one,
it takes care of the exception itself.

```python
def sum_reciprocals(values):
    result = 0
    for v in values:
        result += 1/v
    return result

numbers = [-1, 0, 1]
try:
    one_over = sum_reciprocals(numbers)
except ArithmeticError as error:
    print('Error trying to sum reciprocals: {}'.format(error))
```

```text
Error trying to sum reciprocals: division by zero
```

This leads to the rule "throw low, catch high":
write most of your code without exception handlers,
since there's nothing useful you can do in the middle of a small utility function,
but put a few handlers in the main body of your program
to catch and report all errors.

## What exceptions should I raise and catch? {#errors-where}

Now that we have learned about error handling,
we can go ahead and add it to our Zipf's Law code.
First,
there is already some error handling built in,
e.g. if you try to read a file that does not exist,
the error handling inside the `open` function throws a `FileNotFoundError`:

```shell
python bin/collate.py results/none.csv
```

```text
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "bin/collate.py", line 27, in <module>
    main(args)
  File "bin/collate.py", line 17, in main
    with open(file_name, 'r') as reader:
FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'results/none.csv'
```

But what happens if we try to read a file that exists,
but was not created by `countwords.py`?


```shell
$ python bin/collate.py Makefile
```

```text
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "bin/collate.py", line 27, in <module>
    main(args)
  File "bin/collate.py", line 18, in main
    update_counts(reader, word_counts)
  File "bin/collate.py", line 10, in update_counts
    for word, count in csv.reader(reader):
ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)
```

This error is not that easy to understand
unless you are familiar with the code's internals.
Our program should therefore check that the input files are CSV-files,
and if not,
raise an error with a useful explanation to what went wrong.
We could achieve this by wrapping the open statement in a `try/except` clause:

```python
for file_name in args.infiles:
    try:
        with open(file_name, 'r') as reader:
            update_counts(reader, word_counts)
    except ValueError as e:
        print(f'{file_name} is not a CSV-file.')
        print(f'ValueError: {e}')
```

```shell
$ python bin/collate.py Makefile
```

```text
Makefile is not a CSV-file.
ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)
```

This is definitely more informative than before.
However,
an issue with this approach is that all `ValueErrors`
that are raised when trying to open a file
will result in this error message,
including those potentially raised when actually using a CSV-file as input.
A more precise approach in this case would be to throw an exception specifically
if a file other than a CSV-file is passed as input:

```python
for file_name in args.infiles:
    if file_name[-4:] != '.csv':
        raise OSError(f'{file_name} is not a CSV-file.')
    with open(file_name, 'r') as reader:
        update_counts(reader, word_counts)
```

```shell
$ python bin/collate.py Makefile
```

```text
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "bin/collate.py", line 29, in <module>
    main(args)
  File "bin/collate.py", line 18, in main
    raise OSError(f'{file_name} is not a valid CSV-file of word counts.')
OSError: Makefile is not a CSV-file.
```

This is not perfect:
ideally we should check the content of the file
and confirm that the format is that of the output files from `countwords.py`,
instead of relying on the file extension.
This could involve checking that there are two columns separated by a comma,
that the first column contains strings,
and that the second is numerical.
But for the purpose of demonstration,
our sample code above works fine.

The `if/raise` approach is commonly referred to as "look before your leap",
while the `try/except` approach above is called
"it's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission".

The first approach is more precise,
but has the shortcoming that programmers never can anticipate all of the things
that can go wrong when running a program,
so there should always be an `except` somewhere
to deal with unexpected cases.
In our code,
this is often dealt with in an informative way
by the exceptions in the built-in Python functions,
such as that which was displayed by open
when we tried reading non-existing file.

Generally speaking,
we should distinguish between [internal errors][internal-error],
such as calling a function with `None` instead of a list,
and [external errors][external-error],
such as trying to read a file that doesn't exist.
Internal errors should be forestalled by unit testing (Chapter \@ref(correct)),
but software always encounters new situations in the real world
and those situations can trigger previously unseen bugs.
When an internal error occurs,
the only thing we can do in most cases is report it and halt the program.
If a function has been passed `None` instead of a valid list,
for example,
the odds are good that one of our data structures is corrupted
(or at least in an unexpected state).
We can try to guess what the problem is and take corrective action,
but experience teaches us that our guess will often be wrong
and our attempt to correct the problem might actually make things worse.

External errors,
on the other hand,
are usually caused by interactions between the program and the outside world:
for example,
a user may mis-type a filename or the network might be down.
Section \@ref(correct-failure) describes some ways to test that
software is doing the right thing in these situations,
but we still need to report them.
Alternatively,
if we're interacting with a user,
it might make sense for us to prompt them to try again:
it's easy to mis-type a password or select the wrong file for analysis,
and users shouldn't have to re-start the program to correct something like this.

The one rule we should *always* follow is to check for errors as early as possible
so that we don't waste the user's time.
Few things are as frustrating as being told at the end of an hour-long calculation
that the program doesn't have permission to write to an output directory.
It's a little extra work to check things like this up front,
but the larger your program or the longer it runs,
the more useful those checks will be.

## How can I write useful error messages? {#errors-messages}

The error message shown in Figure \@ref(fig:errors-error-message) is not helpful:

```{r errors-error-message, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="An Unhelpful Error Message"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/py-rse/scripting/error-message.png")
```

In the context of our example with `collate.py`,
a bad error message could have looked like this:

```text
OSError: Something went wrong, try again.
```

This doesn't provide any information on what went wrong,
so it is difficult to know what to change for next time.
A better,
but still subpar message would have been:

```text
OSError: Unsupported file type.
```

At least we now know that it is the file type which is not correct,
but we don't get any information on what file types are supported,
so we still would have to do a lot of guesswork or read the source code.
A more informative message error is that which we wrote in the previous section:

```text
OSError: The file is not a CSV-file.
```

This makes it cleat that the program only works with CSV files.
However,
since we don't actually check the content of the file,
this message could confuse someone who has comma-separated values saved in a `.txt` file.
We could be even more explicit:

```text
OSError: The filename must end in `.csv`.
```

This tells us exactly what criteria need to be met to avoid the error.

Error messages are often the first thing people actually read about a piece of software
(or possibly the second if they had to install it themselves),
so they should therefore be the most carefully written documentation for that software.
A quick web search for "writing good error messages" turns up hundreds of hits,
but recommendations are often more like gripes than solid guidelines
and are usually not backed up by evidence.
What research there is gives us the following rules @Beck2016:

1.  Do not tell the user what the program did that caused the problem,
    but what the user did.
    Putting it another way,
    the message shouldn't state the effect of the error,
    it should state the cause.

2.  Be spatially correct,
    i.e.,
    point at the actual location of the error.
    Few things are as frustrating as being pointed at line 28
    when the problem is really on line 35.

3.  Do not provide tips or potential solutions.
    In most languages it is not possible to determine what the actual error is from the message with 100% certainty.
    Therefore it is better to give an as-specific-as-possible message on what went wrong without offering guidance on fixing it.
    Tips and hints could be provided by a different tool,
    but they should be based on the error message and not part of it.

4.  Be as specific as possible without ever being (or seeming) wrong:
    from a user's point of view,
    "file not found" is very different from "don't have permissions to open file" or "file is empty".

5.  Write for your audience's level of understanding.
    For example, error messages should never use programming terms more advanced than
    those you would use to describe the code the user wrote.

6.  Do not blame the user, and do not use words like fatal, illegal, etc.
    The former can frustrate—in many cases, "user error" actually isn't—and
    the latter can make people worry that the program has damaged their data,
    their computer,
    or their reputation.

7.  Do not try to make the computer sound like a human being.
    In particular, avoid humor:
    very few jokes are funny on the dozenth re-telling,
    and most users are going to see error messages at least that often.

8.  Use a consistent vocabulary.
    This rule can be hard to enforce when error messages are written by several different people,
    but putting them all in one module makes review easier.

That last suggestion deserves a little elaboration.
Most people write error messages directly in their code:

```python
if file_name[-4:] != '.csv':
    raise OSError(f'{file_name} must end in `.csv`.')
```

A better approach for large projects is to put all the error messages in a dictionary,
which can be assigned to a global variable in separate file:

```python
ERROR_MESSAGES = {
    'cannot_read_file' : f'{file_name} must end in `.csv`.',
    'config_corrupted' : f'Configuration file {config_name} corrupted',
    # ...more error messages...
}
```

and then only use messages from that dictionary:

```python
from error_messages import ERROR_MESSAGES


if file_name[-4:] != '.csv':
    raise OSError(ERROR_MESSAGES['cannot_read_file'])
```

Doing this makes it much easier to ensure that messages are consistent.
It also makes it much easier to give messages in the user's preferred language:

```python
ERROR_MESSAGES = {
    'en' : {
        'cannot_read_file' : f'{file_name} must end in `.csv`.',
        'config_corrupted' : f'Configuration file {config_name} corrupted',
        # ...more error messages in English...
    },
    'fr' : {
        'cannot_read_file' : f'{file_name} doit se terminer par `.csv`',
        'config_corrupted' : f'Fichier de configuration {config_name} corrompu',
        # ...more error messages in French...
    }
    # ...other languages...
}
```

The error report is then looked up as:

```python
ERROR_MESSAGES[user_language]['cannot_read_file']
```

where `user_language` is a two-letter code for the user's preferred language.

## How should I report errors? {#errors-logging}

Programs should report things that go wrong.
They should also sometimes report things that go right
so that people can monitor their progress
and down the sources of errors.
Adding `print` statements for debugging is a common approach,
but removing them or commenting them out,
only to add them again,
is tedious—especially when the software is in production.

A better approach is to use a [logging framework][logging-framework],
such as Python's `logging` library.
This lets you leave your debugging statements in your code
and turn them on or off at will.
It also lets you send output to any of several destinations,
which is helpful when your data analysis pipeline has several stages
and you're trying to figure out which one contains a bug
(or whether the problem lies in their interaction).

To understand how logging frameworks work,
suppose we want to turn `print` statements in our program on or off
without editing the program's source code.
We would probably wind up with code like this:

```python
if LOG_LEVEL > 0:
    print('Processing files...')
for file_name in args.infiles:
    if LOG_LEVEL > 1:
        print(f'Reading in {file_name}...')
    if file_name[-4:] != '.csv':
        raise OSError(f'{file_name} is not a CSV-file.')
    with open(file_name, 'r') as reader:
        if LOG_LEVEL > 1:
            print(f'Computing word counts...')
        update_counts(reader, word_counts)
```

Here,
`LOG_LEVEL` acts as a threshold:
any debugging output at a lower level isn't printed.
So the first log message will always be printed,
but the other two only in case the user has requested more details
with a higher value to `LOG_LEVEL`.

Logging frameworks combine the `if` and the `print` statements,
and define standard names for the logging levels.
In order of decreasing severity,
the levels are:

-   `CRITICAL`: potential loss of data, security breach, etc.
-   `ERROR`: something has gone badly wrong, but the program hasn't hurt anything.
-   `WARNING`: something unexpected happened, but the program will keep going.
-   `INFO`: confirmation that things are working as expected.
-   `DEBUG`: very detailed information used for localizing errors.

Each of these has a corresponding function:
we can use `logging.debug`, `logging.info`, etc. to write messages at these levels.
By default,
only `WARNING` and above are displayed;
messages appear on [standard error][standard-error]
so that the flow of data in pipes isn't affected.
The source of the message appears as well,
which is called `root` by default.
Thus,
if we run the small program shown below,
only the warning message appears:

```python
import logging


logging.warning('This is a warning.')
logging.info('This is just for information.')
```

```text
WARNING:root:This is a warning.
```

Rewriting the `collate.py` example above using the logging module
yields code that is less cluttered:

```python
import logging


logging.info('Processing files...')
for file_name in args.infiles:
    logging.debug('Reading in {file_name}...')
    if file_name[-4:] != '.csv':
        raise OSError(f'{file_name} is not a CSV-file.')
    with open(file_name, 'r') as reader:
        logging.debug('Computing word counts...')
        update_counts(reader, word_counts)
```

We can also configure logging to send messages to a file instead of to standard error
using `logging.basicConfig`.
This has to be done before we make any logging calls,
it's not retroactive.
We can use the same function to set the logging level:
everything at or above the specified level is displayed.

```python
import logging


logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG, filename='logging.log')

logging.debug('This is for debugging.')
logging.info('This is just for information.')
logging.warning('This is a warning.')
logging.error('Something went wrong.')
logging.critical('Something went seriously wrong.')
```

```text
DEBUG:root:This is for debugging.
INFO:root:This is just for information.
WARNING:root:This is a warning.
ERROR:root:Something went wrong.
CRITICAL:root:Something went seriously wrong.
```

By default,
`basicConfig` re-opens the log file in [append mode][append-mode];
we can use `filemode='w'` to overwrite the existing log data.
This is useful during debugging,
but we should think twice before doing in production,
since the information we throw away always turns out to have been exactly what we needed to find a bug.

Many programs allow users to specify logging levels and log file names as command-line parameters.
At its simplest,
this is a single flag `-v` or `--verbose` that changes the logging level from `WARNING` (the default)
to `DEBUG` (the noisiest level).
There may also be a corresponding flag `-q` or `--quiet` that changes the level to `ERROR`,
and a flag `-l` or `--logfile` that specifies a log file name
(with standard error being the default for message output).

The default configuration in the logging modules uses a single handler,
by default one that prints the logging messages,
and if we specify a filename it switches to one that writes the messages to file.
To log messages to a file while also printing them,
you can specify to use two handlers simultaneously in the logging configuration:

```python
import logging


logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.DEBUG,
    handlers=[
        logging.FileHandler("logging.log"),
        logging.StreamHandler()])

logging.debug('This is for debugging.')
```

The string `'This is for debugging'` message is both printed to stderr
and appended to `logging.log`.

Libraries like `logging` can send messages to many destinations:
e.g. a centralized logging server that collates logs from many different systems.
Another good practice is [rotating files][rotating-file]
so that the system always has messages from the last few hours
but doesn't fill up the disk.
We don't need any of these when we start,
but the data engineers and system administrators
who eventually have to install and maintain your programs
will be very grateful that you used `logging`,
because then they can set it up the way they want with very little work.

## Summary {#errors-summary}

FIXME: summarize errors chapter

## Exercises {#errors-exercises}

### Handling exceptions {#errors-ex-exceptions}

1.  Modify the script `collate.py` so that it catches any exceptions
    that are raised when it tries to open files.
    When you are finished,
    the program should collate all the files it can
    rather than halting as soon as it encounters a problem.
2.  Modify your first solution to handle nonexistent files
    and permission problems separately.

### Error catalogs {#errors-ex-catalog}

1.  Modify your solution to the previous exercise
    to put your error message in a catalog
    as described in Section \@ref(errors-messages).
2.  Add messages in a second language.
    (Use Google Translate if necessary).
3.  Add a command-line flag to allow users to select the language they want to use.

### Set the logging level {#errors-ex-set-level}

1.  Modify the way command-line arguments are handled by `collate.py`
    so that users can adjust the logging level from the command line.
