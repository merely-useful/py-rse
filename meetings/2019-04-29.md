    -   Passed
5.  [Discussion #9](https://github.com/merely-useful/merely-useful.github.io/issues/9): What tools to use for practical exercises in the novice course? (10 min)
    -   Use RStudio IDE for R
    -   Keep content tool-neutral for Python and provide instructors' guides for common options
        -   Expect that each instructor will pick a tool and introduce it to their class
6.  Open discussion: who wants to work on what? (10 min)
    -   Novice material will be separate for R and Python
        -   GW will create tickets for each
        -   Add yourself to the language you're most interested in working on initially
    -   We need 4-6 running examples
        -   GW will create a ticket asking for data sets
            -   Please also add examples of exercises that can be done with those data sets
            -   Work backward from exercises to lesson structure
        -   Try to get a variety of data sets: one language processing, one health care/time series, etc.
        -   Try to avoid the usual suspects (gapminder, iris, etc.)
    -   Talk about social/ethical implications throughout rather than segregating to one section
7.  Choose date and moderator for next meeting (5 min)
    -   MBF will moderate
    -   Date TBD (May 8?)
