The more software you write,
the more you realize that a programming language is mostly
a way to build and combine software packages.
Every widely-used language now has an online [repository][repository]
from which people can download and install packages,
and sharing yours is a great way to contribute to the community
that has helped you get where you are.
This lesson shows you how to use R's tools to do this.

### Exercise: What packages do you have?

What R packages are currently installed on your computer?
How did you figure this out?

### Exercise: Can you build a package?

1.  Clone the GitHub repository for the `here` package at <https://github.com/r-lib/here>.
2.  Open `here.Rproj` in RStudio.
3.  Build the package.

Does the package build successfully?
What messages do you see?
Do any of them worry you?

## What *is* a package, exactly? {#r-rse-package-r-background}

Suppose you have written a useful R script and want to share it with colleagues.
You could email it to them (or point them at the GitHub repository it's in),
but what should they do next?
They could copy the file onto their computer,
but then they would have to decide where to put it
and remember their decision later on when you updated the script to fix a few bugs.
And what about the documentation you so lovingly crafted—where should it go?
Oh,
and what if different people decide to organize their files differently—how
hard will it be to make the things they have built play nicely together?

[Packages][package] solve these problems.
While the details vary from language to language,
packages always require that information about the software
be stored in a specific format and in a specific location,
so that statements like `library(something)` know where to find what they need.
They are rather like the USB ports of the software world:
anything that conforms to a few simple rules can plug in to anything else.

## How do I create a package? {#r-rse-package-r-create}

An R package must contain the following files:

-   The text file `DESCRIPTION` (with no suffix) describes what the package does,
    who wrote it,
    and what other packages it requires to run.
    We will edit its contents as we go along.

-   [`NAMESPACE`][namespace],
    (whose name also has no suffix)
    contains the names of everything exported from the package
    (i.e., everything that is visible to the outside world).
    As we will see,
    we should leave its management in the hands of RStudio
    and the `devtools` package we will meet below.

-   Just as `.gitignore` tells Git what files in a project to ignore,
    `.Rbuildignore` tells R which files to include or not include in the package.

-   All of the R source for our package must go in a directory called `R`;
    subdirectories below this are not allowed.

-   As you would expect from its name,
    the optional `data` directory contains any data we have put in our package.
    In order for it to be loadable as part of the package,
    the data must be saved in R's custom `.rda` format.
    We will see how to do this below.

-   Manual pages go in the `man` directory.
    The bad news is that they have to be in a sort-of-LaTeX format
    that is only a bit less obscure than the runes inscribed on the ancient dagger
    your colleague brought back from her latest archeological dig.
    The good news is,
    we can embed Markdown comments in our source code
    and use a tool called `roxygen2`
    to extract them and translate them into the format that R packages require.

-   The `tests` directory holds the package's unit tests.
    It should contain files with names like <code>test_<em>some_feature</em>.R</code>,
    which should in turn contain functions named <code>test_<em>something_specific</em></code>.
    We'll have a closer look at these in Chapter \@ref(r-rse-correct).

You can type all of this in if you want,
but R has a very useful package called `usethis` that will help you create and maintain packages.
To show how it works,
we will create an R package called `zipffreq` (with no dashes or other special characters in its name)
to hold word frequencies in classic English novels.
The first step is to load `usethis` in the console with `library(usethis)`
and use `usethis::create_package`
with the path to the new package directory as an argument:

```{r create-zipffreq, eval=FALSE}
usethis::create_package('~/zipffreq')
```
```
✔ Setting active project to '/Users/hamilton/zipffreq'
✔ Creating 'R/'
✔ Creating 'man/'
✔ Writing 'DESCRIPTION'
✔ Writing 'NAMESPACE'
✔ Writing 'zipffreq.Rproj'
✔ Adding '.Rproj.user' to '.gitignore'
✔ Adding '^zipffreq\\.Rproj$', '^\\.Rproj\\.user$' to '.Rbuildignore'
✔ Opening new project 'zipffreq' in RStudio
```

Every well-behaved package should have a README file,
a license,
and a Code of Conduct,
so we will ask `usethis` to add those:

```{r zipffreq-boilerplate, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_readme_md()
usethis::use_mit_license(name="Merely Useful")
usethis::use_code_of_conduct()
```

(Note that `use_mit_license` creates two files: `LICENSE` and `LICENSE.md`.
The rules for R packages require the former,
but GitHub expects the latter.)
We then edit `README.md` to be:

```
# zipffreq

An example package for Merely Useful that checks Zipf's Law for classic English novels.

## Installation

TBD

## Example

FIXME: add an example.
```

and make a similar edit to `DESCRIPTION` so that it contains:

```
Package: zipffreq
Title: Checks Zipf's Law for classic English novels.
Version: 0.0.0.9000
Authors@R:
    person(given = "Merely",
           family = "Useful",
           role = c("aut", "cre"),
           email = "merely.useful@gmail.com")
Description: >
  Contains data and functions for checking Zipf's Law
  for a set of classic English novels.
License: MIT + file LICENSE
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: true
```

We can now go to the `Build` tab in RStudio and run `Check`
to see if our empty package makes sense.
When we do,
the check warns us that there shouldn't be a period at the end of the package title.
Once we fix that,
we get a clean bill of health.

> ### Leftovers
>
> Running `Check` creates another directory called `zipffreq.Rcheck`
> and a file called `zipffreq_0.0.0.9000.tar.gz`.
> These are created beside our project directory rather than in it
> so as not to confuse version control—we don't want
> the files we are building committed to our repository.

We can now create a placeholder for one of the functions we want to write
in a file called `R/frequency.R`
either by using `File…New` in RStudio
or by running `usethis::use_r('frequency.R')`
(which always creates the file in the `R` directory):

```{r frequency-original}
word_count <- function(word, text) {
  0
}
```

`Build…Check` runs a lot more checks now
because we have some actual code for it to look at.
It warns us that our function needs documentation,
so we will look at that next.

### Exercise: Packaging the CO2 functions

1.  Create a brand-new package to hold the CO2 data and functions for analyzing it.
2.  Put the license file where R's packaging rules wants it.
3.  Read the documentation for `usethis::use_citation` and create a citation file.
4.  Build the package: what warnings do you get and what do they mean?

### Exercise: Exploring a package

1.  Clone a GitHub repository that contains an R package, such as <https://github.com/r-lib/usethis>.
2.  Which files in this repository do you recognize, and what are they for?
3.  Which files are there to satisfy something other than R's packaging system?

### Exercise: Ignoring Files

What does `usethis::use_build_ignore` do?
When would you use it?

## How do I use a package while I'm creating it? {#r-rse-package-r-use}

The `devtools` package includes functions to help you create and test packages.
After you install it,
`devtools::load_all("path/to/package")`
will do the same thing that `library(package)` does,
but use the files you are developing.
(If you run `load_all()` without a path,
it will re-load the package in the current working directory,
which is what you usually want to do during development.)

`devtools::load_all` is different from `devtools::install`,
which not only installs your package,
but also tries to install its dependencies from CRAN.
After you use `install`,
the package will be available to other projects on your computer.
This is therefore usually one of the last things you do
as you come to the end of development.

## How do I document a R package? {#r-rse-package-r-document}

Our next task is to document our function.
To do this,
we turn to Hadley Wickham's *[R Packages][wickham-packages]*
and Karl Broman's "[R package primer][broman-packages]"
for advice on writing roxygen2.
We then return to our source file and put a specially-formatted comment in front of our code:

```{r frequency-doc}
#' Count how often a word appears in a piece of text
#'
#' @param word the word to search for
#' @param text the text to search in
#'
#' @return number of times the word appears in the text
#'
#' @export

word_count <- function(word, text) {
  0
}
```

This comment text,
is an example of [embedded documentation][embedded-documentation],
can be easily inserted by placing the cursor somewhere in the function
and clicking the button "Code -> Insert Roxygen Skeleton" in RStudio.
Over the years,
programmers have found that if they put code in one file and documentation in another,
the documentation quickly falls out of date with the code:
people will change a function's name or add a new parameter and forget to update the docs.
If the documentation lives right beside the code,
on the other hand,
the next person to modify the code is far more likely to remember to update it.
Tools like roxygen2 can read the code,
extract the documentation,
and format it as HTML or PDF.
They can also do things like create an index,
which would be even more painful to do by hand than writing the documentation itself.

roxygen2 processes comment lines that start with `#'` (hash followed by single quote).
Putting a comment block right before a function associates that documentation with that function,
and `@something` indicates a roxygen2 command,
so what this file is saying is:

-   the function has two parameters called `word` and `text`
-   it returns the number of times the word is found in the text; and
-   we want to export it (i.e., we want it to be visible outside the package).

These roxygen2 text can also be written with [Markdown formatting][roxygen-md],
so that for instance using `**word**` will bold the word. Other common formatting
includes:

- `[function_name()]` or `[object_name]` to link to other function or object,
respectively, documentation in the same package.
- `[pkgname::function_name()]` or `[pkgname::object_name]` to link to function
or object, respectively, documentation in another package.
- `[link name](website-link)` to link to a website.

To enable Markdown with roxygen2 we'll need to install the package roxygen2md package
and use:

```r
roxygen2md::roxygen2md("full")
```

which will output something like:

```
✔ Setting active project to '/Users/hamilton/zipffreq'
No files changed.
✔ 0 source files changed
ℹ Running `devtools::document()`
Updating zipffreq documentation
Writing NAMESPACE
Loading zipffreq
Writing NAMESPACE
● Review the changes carefully
● Commit the changes to version control
✔ Setting active project to '<no active project>'
```

This converts all existing documentation to use Markdown version and will also
add this line to the `DESCRIPTION` file:

```
Roxygen: list(markdown = TRUE)
```

Ok, our function is now documented,
but when we run `Check`,
we still get a warning.
After a bit more searching and experimentation,
we discover that we need to run `devtools::document()` to regenerate documentation
because it isn't done automatically.
When we do this,
we get:

```
Updating zipffreq documentation
Updating roxygen version in /Users/hamilton/zipffreq/DESCRIPTION
Writing NAMESPACE
Loading zipffreq
Writing NAMESPACE
Writing word_count.Rd
```

We now have two files to look at:
`NAMESPACE` and `word_count.Rd`.
The first looks like this:

```{r zipffreq-namespace, eval=FALSE}
# Generated by roxygen2: do not edit by hand

export(word_count)
```

The comment at the start tells roxygen2 it can overwrite the file,
and reminds us that we shouldn't edit it by hand.
The `export(word_count)` directive is what we really want:
as you might guess from the name `export`,
it tells the package builder to make this function visible outside the package.

What about `word_count.Rd`?
It lives in the `man` directory
and now contains:

```
% Generated by roxygen2: do not edit by hand
% Please edit documentation in R/frequency.R
\name{word_count}
\alias{word_count}
\title{Count how often a word appears in a piece of text}
\usage{
word_count(word, text)
}
\arguments{
\item{word}{the word to search for}

\item{text}{the text to search in}
}
\value{
number of times the word appears in the text
}
\description{
Count how often a word appears in a piece of text
}
```

Again,
there's a comment at the top to remind us that we shouldn't edit this by hand.
After doing this,
we go into "Build…More…Configure build tools" and check "Generate documentation with Roxygen".
Running `Check` again now gives us a clean bill of health.
If we use the `Install and Restart` button in RStudio's `Build` tab,
we can now use `?word_count` in the console to view our help.

### Exercise: Document a function

FIXME: write this exercise once the CO2 manipulation functions exist.

### Exercise: Use Markdown documentation

Read the documentation for the `roxygen2md` package,
which allows you to write R documentation in Markdown,
and then convert `zipffreq` to use Markdown documentation.

## What should I document? {#r-rse-package-r-docwhat}

The answer to the question in this section's title depends on what stage of development you are in.
If you are doing [exploratory programming][exploratory-programming],
a one-line comment to remind yourself of each function's purpose is good enough.
(In fact, it's probably better than what most people do.)
That comment should begin with an active verb and describe
how inputs are turned into outputs.
If the function has any [side effects][side-effects],
you should eliminate them.
If you can't,
you should describe them too.

An active verb is something like "extract", "normalize", or "find".
For example,
these are all good one-line comments:

-   "Create a list of current ages from a list of birth dates."
-   "Ensure training parameters lie in [0..1]."
-   "Reduce the red component of each pixel."

You can tell your one-liners are useful
if you can read them aloud in the order the functions are called
in place of the function's name and parameters.

Once you start writing code for other people—including yourself three months from now—your
documentation should describe:

1.  The name and purpose of every function and constant in your code.
2.  The name, purpose, and default value (if any) of every parameter to every function.
3.  Any side effects the function has.
4.  The type of value returned by every function.
5.  Why and how the function will deliberately fail.
    If a function uses something like `stopifnot` or `assert` to check that a condition holds,
    then that halt-and-catch-fire behavior is effectively part of its interface.

### Exercise: Fixing documentation

FIXME: provide poorly-documented function in CO2 package and ask learner to find and fix gaps.

### Exercise: Cross-references

1.  What should you add to the roxygen2 comments for one function to link to the documentation for another function?
2.  Add a cross-reference from the documentation for the function FIXME in the CO2 package to the documentation for the function FIXME.

### Exercise: Documenting error conditions

The guidelines above said that authors should document why and how their functions will deliberately fail.
Where and how should you do this using roxygen2 for R?

## How do I manage package dependencies? {#r-rse-package-r-dependencies}

In order to understand the rest of what follows,
it's important to understand that R packages are distributed as compiled [byte code][byte-code],
*not* as [source code][source-code] (which is how Python does it)
or as [binary code][binary-code] (which is how app stores distribute things).
When a package is built,
R loads and checks the code,
then saves the corresponding low-level instructions.
Our R files should therefore define functions,
not run commands immediately:
if they do the latter,
those commands will be executed every time the script loads,
which is probably not what users will want.

As a side effect,
this means that if a package uses `load(something)`,
then that `load` command is executed *while the package is being compiled*,
and *not* while the compiled package is being loaded by a user after distribution
(Figure \@ref(fig:package-distribution)).
If we have loaded the library by hand in our R session during development,
though,
we might not notice the problem.

```{r package-distribution, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Package Distribution"}
knitr::include_graphics("figures/FIXME.png")
```

How then can our packages use other packages?
The safest way is to use [fully-qualified names][fully-qualified-name]
such as `stringr::str_replace`
every time we call a function from another package or that is defined somewhere outside our package.
Let's modify our word counter to use `stringr::str_count`:

```{r word-count-stringr, eval=FALSE}
word_count <- function(word, text) {
  stringr::str_count(text, word)
}
```

Since our compiled-and-distributable package will only contain the compiled code for its own functions,
direct calls to functions from other packages won't work after the package is installed.
To fix this,
we ask `usethis` to add a note about `stringr` to `DESCRIPTION`:

```{r use-package-stringr, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_package('stringr')
```

The bottom of `DESCRIPTION` now has these two lines:

```
Imports:
    stringr
```

The `Imports` field in `DESCRIPTION` tells R what else it has to install when it installs our package.
To be explicit about the version of the package, we can run:

```r
usethis::use_tidy_versions()
```

Which will add the version of the package to the `DESCRIPTION` file, which will
look like:

```
Imports:
    stringr (>= 1.4.0)
```

(See Section \@ref(r-rse-git-advanced-tag) for a discussion of version numbering.)

All right: are we done now?
No, we are not:

### Exercise: Document dependencies

1.  Modify the functions in the CO2 package to use `package::function` name for everything.
2.  Modify the `DESCRIPTION` file to document the package's dependencies.

### Importing

1.  What does `@import` do in roxygen2 documentation?
2.  When should or shouldn't you use it?

## How can I share my package via GitHub? {#r-rse-package-r-github}

We said in Section \@ref(r-rse-package-r-intro) that R packages could be shared through GitHub
as well as through CRAN.
If someone has done this,
installing the package on your computer is as simple as:

```{r install-from-github, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("username/reponame")
```

where `username` and `reponame` are the names of the user and the project respectively.
If you want to share your work,
all you have to do is create a repository whose contents are laid out
as described earlier in this chapter:
if it looks like an R project,
`install_github` will treat it as one.

## How can I add data to a package? {#r-rse-package-r-data}

The last steps are to add some cleaned-up data to our package
and document the package as a whole. If we want to create fake data or clean up
raw data, we should first run the command:

```r
# Let's name the data "small_data", but it can be anything.
usethis::use_data_raw("small_data")
```

which outputs:

```
✔ Creating 'data-raw/'
✔ Adding '^data-raw$' to '.Rbuildignore'
✔ Writing 'data-raw/small_data.R'
● Modify 'data-raw/small_data.R'
● Finish the data preparation script in 'data-raw/small_data.R'
● Use `usethis::use_data()` to add prepared data to package
```

that creates the `data-raw/` folder and the `small_data.R` file in that folder.
Inside that new file is:

```
## code to prepare `small_data` dataset goes here

usethis::use_data("small_data")
```

Let's replace the first comment with:

```{r create-sample-tibble, eval=FALSE}
small_data <- tribble(
  ~word,  ~ count,
  "some",   2,
  "words",  1,
  "appear", 1,
  "times",  1)
```

which looks like:

```
# A tibble: 4 x 2
  word   count
  <chr>  <dbl>
1 some       2
2 words      1
3 appear     1
4 times      1
```

Remove the quotes within the `use_data()`. The new file should contain the code:

```r
small_data <- tribble(
  ~word,  ~ count,
  "some",   2,
  "words",  1,
  "appear", 1,
  "times",  1
  )

usethis::use_data(small_data)
```

Run the script by hitting "Source" (or `source("data-raw/small_data.R")`). This
will output:

```
✔ Creating 'data/'
✔ Saving 'small_data' to 'data/small_data.rda'
```

Now the `small_data` data.frame object is saved to `data/` and is now accessible
throughout the package!

When we run `Check`,
we get a complaint about an undocumented data set,
so we create a file called `R/small_data.R` to hold documentation about the dataset
and put this in it:

```{r dataset-doc, eval=FALSE}
#' Sample word frequency data.
#'
#' This small dataset contains word frequencies for tutorial purposes.
#'
#' @docType data
#'
#' @format A data frame
#' \describe{
#'   \item{word}{The word being counted (chr)}
#'   \item{n}{The number of occurrences (int)}
#' }
"small_data"
```

Everything except the last line is a roxygen2 comment block
that describes the data in plain language,
then uses some tags and directives to document its format and fields.
The line `@docType` tells roxygen2 that this comment describes data rather than a function,
and the last line is the string `"small_data"`,
i.e.,
the name of the dataset.
We will create one placeholder R file like this for each of our datasets,
and each will have that dataset's name as the thing being documented.

Running `Check` now gives us a different warning:

```
    Warning: package needs dependence on R (>= 2.10)
```

We do *not* fix this by adding another line under `Imports` in `DESCRIPTION`,
since R itself isn't a package.
Instead,
we add this line:

```
Depends: R (>= 2.10)
```

and get a clean bill of health.

We use a similar trick to document the package as a whole:
we create a file `R/zipffreq.R`
(i.e., a file with exactly the same name as the package)
and put this in it:

```{r package-doc, eval=FALSE}
#' Example of an R package.
#'
#' @author Merely Useful, \email{merely.useful@gmail.com}
#' @docType package
#' @name zipffreq
NULL
```

That's right:
to document the entire package,
we document `NULL`.
One last build,
and our package is ready to deliver.

> ### The Virtues of Laziness
>
> We should always put `LazyData: TRUE` in `DESCRIPTION`
> so that datasets are only loaded on demand.

### Exercise: Letting `usethis` do even more work

What does `usethis::use_package_doc` do?

### Exercise: Scripting data creation

1.  Put the code two create `small_data` in an R script in `data-raw` via `usethis::use_data_raw()`.
2.  Include `usethis::use_data(small_data)` at the end of the script.
3.  Describe what this script does step by step.

### Exercise: Add sample data to the CO2 package

1.  Create a small sample of the CO2 data in a tibble called `sample_CO2_data`.
2.  Save it and document it.

### Exercise: Reproducible data set creation

1.  Write a small script to create and save the sample dataset from the previous exercise.
2.  Where should this script go in your package? How should you document its existence and usage?
3.  Swap packages with a colleague. Can you regenerate their sample data using only what is (documented) in their package?
